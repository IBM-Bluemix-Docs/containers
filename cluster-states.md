   <td>Aborted</td>
   <td>The deletion of the cluster is requested by the user before the Kubernetes master is deployed. After the deletion of the cluster is completed, the cluster is removed from your dashboard.

     <td>Critical</td>

     <td>Deleted</td>
     <td>The cluster is deleted but not yet removed from your dashboard. If your cluster is stuck in this state for a long time, open an [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} support ticket](cs_troubleshoot.html#ts_getting_help). </td>

   <td>Deleting</td>

       <td>Normal</td>
       <td>All worker nodes in a cluster are up and running. You can access the cluster and deploy apps to the cluster. This state is considered healthy and does not require an action from you. **Note**: Although the worker nodes might be normal, other infrastructure resources, such as [networking](cs_troubleshoot_network.html) and [storage](cs_troubleshoot_storage.html), might still need attention.</td>

      <tr>
       <td>Pending</td>
       <td>The Kubernetes master is deployed. The worker nodes are being provisioned and are not available in the cluster yet. You can access the cluster, but you cannot deploy apps to the cluster.  </td>
     </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Requested</td>
     <td>A request to create the cluster and order the infrastructure for the Kubernetes master and worker nodes is sent. When the deployment of the cluster starts, the cluster state changes to <code>Deploying</code>. If your cluster is stuck in the <code>Requested</code> state for a long time, open an [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} support ticket](cs_troubleshoot.html#ts_getting_help). </td>

     <td>Updating</td>
     <td>The Kubernetes API server that runs in your Kubernetes master is being updated to a new Kubernetes API version. During the update you cannot access or change the cluster. Worker nodes, apps, and resources that have been deployed by the user are not modified and continue to run. Wait for the update to complete to review the health of your cluster. </td>

       <td>Warning</td>
       <td>At least one worker node in the cluster is not available, but other worker nodes are available and can take over the workload. </td>
