# Setting up VPN connectivity
{: #vpn}

With VPN connectivity, you can securely connect apps in a Kubernetes cluster on {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} to an on-premises network. You can also connect apps that are external to your cluster to an app that is running inside your cluster.
{:shortdesc}

To connect your worker nodes and apps to an on-premises data center, you can configure a VPN IPSec endpoint with a strongSwan service or with a Vyatta Gateway Appliance or a Fortigate Appliance.

- **strongSwan IPSec VPN Service**: You can set up a [strongSwan IPSec VPN service ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.strongswan.org/) that securely connects your Kubernetes cluster with an on-premises network. The strongSwan IPSec VPN service provides a secure end-to-end communication channel over the internet that is based on the industry-standard Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) protocol suite. To set up a secure connection between your cluster and an on-premises network, you must [install an IPsec VPN gateway in your on-premises data center](/docs/infrastructure/iaas-vpn/set-up-ipsec-vpn.html#setting-up-an-ipsec-connection). Then, you can [configure and deploy the strongSwan IPSec VPN service](#vpn-setup) in a Kubernetes pod.

- **Vyatta Gateway Appliance or Fortigate Appliance**: If you have a larger cluster, want to access non-Kubernetes resources over the VPN, or want to access multiple clusters over a single VPN, you might choose to set up a Vyatta Gateway Appliance or Fortigate Appliance to configure an IPSec VPN endpoint. For more information, see this blog post on [Connecting a cluster to an on-premises data center ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/07/kubernetes-and-bluemix-container-based-workloads-part4/).

## Setting up VPN connectivity with the strongSwan IPSec VPN service Helm chart
{: #vpn-setup}

Set up VPN connectivity by using a Helm chart to deploy the strongSwan IPSec VPN service into your cluster.
{:shortdesc}

Use a Helm chart to configure and deploy the strongSwan IPSec VPN service inside of a Kubernetes pod. Because strongSwan is integrated within your cluster, you don't need an external gateway device. When VPN connectivity is established, routes are automatically configured on all of the worker nodes in the cluster. These routes allow two way connectivity from any pod on any worker node through the VPN tunnel to or from the remote system. For example, the following diagram shows how a strongSwan VPN connection allows communication between a cluster in {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} and an on-premises network:

<img src="images/cs_vpn_strongswan.png" width="700" alt="Expose an app in {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} by using a load balancer" style="width:700px; border-style: none"/>

1. An app in your cluster, `myapp`, receives a request and needs to securely connect to data in your on-premises network.

2. The request to the on-premises data center is forwarded to the IPSec strongSwan VPN pod.  The destination IP address is used to determine which network packets should be sent to the IPSec strongSwan VPN pod.

3. The request is encrypted and sent over the VPN tunnel to the on-premises data center.

4. The incoming request passes through the on-premises firewall and is delivered to the VPN tunnel endpoint (router) where it is decrypted.

5. The VPN tunnel endpoint (router) forwards the request to on-premise server or mainframe depending on the destination IP address specified by the application in step 1. The necessary data is sent back over the VPN connection to `myapp` through the same process.

### Configure the strongSwan Helm chart
{: #vpn_configure}

Before you begin:
* [Install an IPsec VPN gateway in your on-premises data center](/docs/infrastructure/iaas-vpn/set-up-ipsec-vpn.html#setting-up-an-ipsec-connection).
* Either [create a standard cluster](cs_clusters.html#clusters_cli) or [update an existing cluster to version 1.7.4 or later](cs_cluster_update.html#master).
* The cluster must have at least one available public Load Balancer IP address. [You can check to see your available public IP addresses](cs_subnets.html#manage) or [free up a used IP address](cs_subnets.html#free).
* [Target the Kubernetes CLI to the cluster](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure).

For more information about the Helm commands that are used to set up the strongSwan chart, see the <a href="https://docs.helm.sh/helm/" target="_blank">Helm documentation <img src="../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a>.

To configure the Helm chart:

1. [Install Helm for your cluster and add the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} repository to your Helm instance](cs_integrations.html#helm).

2. Save the default configuration settings for the strongSwan Helm chart in a local YAML file.

    ```
    helm inspect values ibm/strongswan > config.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Open the `config.yaml` file and make the following changes to the default values according to the VPN configuration you want. You can find descriptions for more advanced settings in the configuration file comments.

    **Important**: If you do not need to change a property, comment that property out by placing a `#` in front of it.

You can use NAT to remap the cluster's private local IP subnets, the pod subnet (172.30.0.0/16), or the pod service subnet (172.21.0.0/16) to a different private subnet. The VPN tunnel sees remapped IP subnets instead of the original subnets. Remapping happens before the packets are sent over the VPN tunnel as well as after the packets arrive from the VPN tunnel. You can expose both remapped and non-remapped subnets at the same time over the VPN.<br><br>To enable NAT, you can either add an entire subnet or individual IP addresses. If you add an entire subnet (in the format <code>10.171.42.0/24=10.10.10.0/24</code>), remapping is 1-to-1: all of the IP addresses in the internal network subnet are mapped over to external network subnet and vice versa.

4. Save the updated `config.yaml` file.

5. Install the Helm chart to your cluster with the updated `config.yaml` file. The updated properties are stored in a configmap for your chart.

    **Note**: If you have multiple VPN deployments in a single cluster, you can avoid naming conflicts and differentiate between your deployments by choosing more descriptive release names than `vpn`. To avoid the truncation of the release name, limit the release name to 35 characters or less.

    ```
    helm install -f config.yaml --namespace=kube-system --name=vpn ibm/strongswan
    ```
    {: pre}

6. Check the chart deployment status. When the chart is ready, the **STATUS** field near the top of the output has a value of `DEPLOYED`.

    ```
    helm status vpn
    ```
    {: pre}

7. Once the chart is deployed, verify that the updated settings in the `config.yaml` file were used.

    ```
    helm get values vpn
    ```
    {: pre}


### Test and verify the VPN connectivity
{: #vpn_test}

After you deploy your Helm chart, test the VPN connectivity.
{:shortdesc}

1. If the VPN on the on-premises gateway is not active, start the VPN.

2. Set the `STRONGSWAN_POD` environment variable.

    ```
    export STRONGSWAN_POD=$(kubectl get pod -n kube-system -l app=strongswan,release=vpn -o jsonpath='{ .items[0].metadata.name }')
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Check the status of the VPN. A status of `ESTABLISHED` means that the VPN connection was successful.

    ```
    kubectl exec -n kube-system  $STRONGSWAN_POD -- ipsec status
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:

    ```
    Security Associations (1 up, 0 connecting):
    k8s-conn[1]: ESTABLISHED 17 minutes ago, 172.30.244.42[ibm-cloud]...192.168.253.253[on-premises]
    k8s-conn{2}: INSTALLED, TUNNEL, reqid 12, ESP in UDP SPIs: c78cb6b1_i c5d0d1c3_o
    k8s-conn{2}: 172.21.0.0/16 172.30.0.0/16 === 10.91.152.128/26
    ```
    {: screen}

    **Note**:

    <ul>
    <li>When you try to establish VPN connectivity with the strongSwan Helm chart, it is likely that the VPN status is not `ESTABLISHED` the first time. You might need to check the on-premises VPN endpoint settings and change the configuration file several times before the connection is successful: <ol><li>Run `helm delete --purge <release_name>`</li><li>Fix the incorrect values in the configuration file.</li><li>Run `helm install -f config.yaml --namespace=kube-system --name=<release_name> ibm/strongswan`</li></ol>You can also run more checks in the next step.</li>
    <li>If the VPN pod is in an `ERROR` state or continues to crash and restart, it might be due to parameter validation of the `ipsec.conf` settings in the chart's configmap.<ol><li>Check for any validation errors in the strongSwan pod logs by running `kubectl logs -n kube-system $STRONGSWAN_POD`.</li><li>If validation errors exist, run `helm delete --purge <release_name>`<li>Fix the incorrect values in the configuration file.</li><li>Run `helm install -f config.yaml --namespace=kube-system --name=<release_name> ibm/strongswan`</li></ol>If your cluster has a high number of worker nodes, you can also use `helm upgrade` to more quickly apply your changes instead of running `helm delete` and `helm install`.</li>
    </ul>

4. You can further test the VPN connectivity by running the five Helm tests that are included in the strongSwan chart definition.

    ```
    helm test vpn
    ```
    {: pre}

    * If all tests pass, your strongSwan VPN connection is successfully set up.

    * If any test fails, continue to the next step.

5. View the output of a failed test by looking at the logs of the test pod.

    ```
    kubectl logs -n kube-system <test_program>
    ```
    {: pre}

    **Note**: Some of the tests have requirements that are optional settings in the VPN configuration. If some of the tests fail, the failures might be acceptable depending on whether you specified these optional settings. Refer to the following table for more information about each test and why it might fail.

## Upgrading the strongSwan Helm chart
{: #vpn_upgrade}

Make sure your strongSwan Helm chart is up-to-date by upgrading it.
{:shortdesc}

To upgrade your strongSwan Helm chart to the latest version:

  ```
  helm upgrade -f config.yaml --namespace kube-system <release_name> ibm/strongswan
  ```
  {: pre}


### Upgrading from version 1.0.0
{: #vpn_upgrade_1.0.0}

Due to some of the settings that are used in the version 1.0.0 Helm chart, you cannot use `helm upgrade` to update from 1.0.0 to the latest version.
{:shortdesc}

To upgrade from version 1.0.0, you must delete the 1.0.0 chart and install the latest version:

1. Delete the 1.0.0 Helm chart.

    ```
    helm delete --purge <release_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Save the default configuration settings for the latest version of the strongSwan Helm chart in a local YAML file.

    ```
    helm inspect values ibm/strongswan > config.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Update the configuration file and save the file with your changes.

4. Install the Helm chart to your cluster with the updated `config.yaml` file.

    ```
    helm install -f config.yaml --namespace=kube-system --name=<release_name> ibm/strongswan
    ```
    {: pre}

Additionally, certain `ipsec.conf` timeout settings that were hardcoded in 1.0.0 are exposed as configurable properties in later versions. The names and defaults of some of these configurable `ipsec.conf` timeout settings were also changed to be more consistent with strongSwan standards. If you are upgrading your Helm chart from 1.0.0 and want to retain the 1.0.0 version defaults for the timeout settings, add the new settings to your chart configuration file with the old default values.
