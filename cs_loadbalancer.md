# Setting up Load Balancer services
{: #loadbalancer}

Expose a port and use a portable IP address for the load balancer to access the app. Use a public IP address to make an app accessible on the internet, or a private IP address to make an app accessible on your private infrastructure network.

## Configuring access to an app by using the load balancer service type
{: #config}

Unlike with a NodePort service, the portable IP address of the load balancer service is not dependent on the worker node that the app is deployed on. However, a Kubernetes LoadBalancer service is also a NodePort service. A LoadBalancer service makes your app available over the load balancer IP address and port and makes your app available over the service's node ports.
{:shortdesc}

The portable IP address of the load balancer is assigned for you and does not change when you add or remove worker nodes. Therefore, load balancer services are more highly available than NodePort services. Users can select any port for the load balancer and are not limited to the NodePort port range. You can use load balancer services for TCP and UDP protocols.

**Note**: LoadBalancer services do not support TLS termination. If your app requires TLS termination, you can expose your app by using [Ingress](cs_ingress.html), or configure your app to manage the TLS termination.

Before you begin:

-   This feature is available for standard clusters only.
-   You must have a portable public or private IP address available to assign to the load balancer service.
-   A load balancer service with a portable private IP address still has a public node port open on every worker node. To add a network policy to prevent public traffic, see [Blocking incoming traffic](cs_network_policy.html#block_ingress).

To create a load balancer service:

1.  [Deploy your app to the cluster](cs_app.html#app_cli). When you deploy your app to the cluster, one or more pods are created for you that run your app in a container. Ensure that you add a label to your deployment in the metadata section of your configuration file. This label is needed to identify all pods where your app is running so that they can be included in the load balancing.
2.  Create a load balancer service for the app that you want to expose. To make your app available on the public internet or on a private network, create a Kubernetes service for your app. Configure your service to include all the pods that make up your app into the load balancing.
    1.  Create a service configuration file that is named, for example, `myloadbalancer.yaml`.

    2.  Define a load balancer service for the app that you want to expose.
        - If your cluster is on a public VLAN, a portable public IP address is used. Most clusters are on a public VLAN.
        - If your cluster is available on a private VLAN only, then a portable private IP address is used.
        - You can request a portable public or private IP address for a LoadBalancer service by adding an annotation to the configuration file.

        LoadBalancer service that uses a default IP address:

        ```
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        metadata:
          name: <myservice>
        spec:
          type: LoadBalancer
          selector:
            <selectorkey>:<selectorvalue>
          ports:
           - protocol: TCP
             port: 8080
        ```
        {: codeblock}

        LoadBalancer service that uses an annotation to specify a private or public IP address:

        ```
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        metadata:
          name: <myservice>
          annotations:
            service.kubernetes.io/ibm-load-balancer-cloud-provider-ip-type: <public_or_private>
        spec:
          type: LoadBalancer
          selector:
            <selectorkey>:<selectorvalue>
          ports:
           - protocol: TCP
             port: 8080
          loadBalancerIP: <private_ip_address>
        ```
        {: codeblock}

        <thead>

        <tr>
          <td><code>loadBalancerIP</code></td>
          <td>When creating a private LoadBalancer or to use a a specific portable IP address for a public LoadBalancer, replace <em>&lt;loadBalancerIP&gt;</em> with the IP address that you want to use. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-loadbalancer).</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody></table>

    3.  Optional: Configure a firewall by specifying the `loadBalancerSourceRanges` in the spec section. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-cloud-provider-firewall/).

    4.  Create the service in your cluster.

        ```
        kubectl apply -f myloadbalancer.yaml
        ```
        {: pre}

        When your load balancer service is created, a portable IP address is automatically assigned to the load balancer. If no portable IP address is available, the load balancer service cannot be created.

3.  Verify that the load balancer service was created successfully. Replace _&lt;myservice&gt;_ with the name of the load balancer service that you created in the previous step.

    ```
    kubectl describe service <myservice>
    ```
    {: pre}

    **Note:** It might take a few minutes for the load balancer service to be created properly and for the app to be available.

    Example CLI output:

    ```
    Name:                   <myservice>
    Namespace:              default
    Labels:                 <none>
    Selector:               <selectorkey>=<selectorvalue>
    Type:                   LoadBalancer
    Location:               dal10
    IP:                     10.10.10.90
    LoadBalancer Ingress:   192.168.10.38
    Port:                   <unset> 8080/TCP
    NodePort:               <unset> 32040/TCP
    Endpoints:              172.30.171.87:8080
    Session Affinity:       None
    Events:
    FirstSeen	LastSeen	Count	From			SubObjectPath	Type		Reason			Message
      ---------	--------	-----	----			-------------	--------	------			-------
      10s		10s		1	{service-controller }			Normal		CreatingLoadBalancer	Creating load balancer
      10s		10s		1	{service-controller }			Normal		CreatedLoadBalancer	Created load balancer
    ```
    {: screen}

    The **LoadBalancer Ingress** IP address is the portable IP address that was assigned to your load balancer service.

4.  If you created a public load balancer, access your app from the internet.
    1.  Open your preferred web browser.
    2.  Enter the portable public IP address of the load balancer and port. In the example above, the portable public IP address `192.168.10.38` was assigned to the load balancer service.

        ```
        http://192.168.10.38:8080
        ```
