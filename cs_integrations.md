## Adding services to clusters
{: #adding_cluster}

Add an existing {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service instance to your cluster to enable your cluster users to access and use the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service when they deploy an app to the cluster.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin:

1. [Target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to your cluster.
2. [Request an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service](/docs/apps/reqnsi.html#req_instance).
   **Note:** To create an instance of a service in the Washington DC location, you must use the CLI.

**Note:**
<ul><ul>
<li>You can only add {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services that support service keys. If the service does not support service keys, see [Enabling external apps to use {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services](/docs/apps/reqnsi.html#accser_external).</li>
<li>The cluster and the worker nodes must be deployed fully before you can add a service.</li>
</ul></ul>


To add a service:
2.  List available {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services.

    ```
    bx service list
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example CLI output:

    ```
    name                      service           plan    bound apps   last operation
    <service_instance_name>   <service_name>    spark                create succeeded
    ```
    {: screen}

3.  Note the **name** of the service instance that you want to add to your cluster.
4.  Identify the cluster namespace that you want to use to add your service. Choose between the following options.
    -   List existing namespaces and choose a namespace that you want to use.

        ```
        kubectl get namespaces
        ```
        {: pre}

    -   Create a new namespace in your cluster.

        ```
        kubectl create namespace <namespace_name>
        ```
        {: pre}

5.  Add the service to your cluster.

    ```
    bx cs cluster-service-bind <cluster_name_or_id> <namespace> <service_instance_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

    When the service is successfully added to your cluster, a cluster secret is created that holds the credentials of your service instance. Example CLI output:

    ```
    bx cs cluster-service-bind mycluster mynamespace cleardb
    Binding service instance to namespace...
    OK
    Namespace:	mynamespace
    Secret name:     binding-<service_instance_name>
    ```
    {: screen}

6.  Verify that the secret was created in your cluster namespace.

    ```
    kubectl get secrets --namespace=<namespace>
    ```
    {: pre}


To use the service in a pod that is deployed in the cluster, cluster users can access the service credentials of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service by [mounting the Kubernetes secret as a secret volume to a pod](cs_integrations.html#adding_app).

<br />



## Adding services to apps
{: #adding_app}

Encrypted Kubernetes secrets are used to store {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service details and credentials and allow secure communication between the service and the cluster. As the cluster user, you can access this secret by mounting it as a volume to a pod.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin, [target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to your cluster. Make sure that the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service that you want to use in your app was [added to the cluster](cs_integrations.html#adding_cluster) by the cluster admin.

Kubernetes secrets are a secure way to store confidential information, such as user names, passwords, or keys. Rather than exposing confidential information via environment variables or directly in the Dockerfile, secrets must be mounted as a secret volume to a pod in order to be accessible by a running container in a pod.

When you mount a secret volume to your pod, a file named binding is stored in the volume mount directory that includes all information and credentials that you need to access the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service.

1.  List available secrets in your cluster namespace.

    ```
    kubectl get secrets --namespace=<my_namespace>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output:

    ```
    NAME                                    TYPE                                  DATA      AGE
    binding-<service_instance_name>         Opaque                                1         3m

    ```
    {: screen}

2.  Look for a secret of type **Opaque** and note the **name** of the secret. If multiple secrets exist, contact your cluster administrator to identify the correct service secret.

3.  Open your preferred editor.

4.  Create a YAML file to configure a pod that can access the service details through a secret volume. If you bound more than one service, verify that each secret is associated with the correct service.

    ```
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: secret-test
      name: secret-test
      namespace: <my_namespace>
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: secret-test
      replicas: 1
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: secret-test
        spec:
          containers:
          - image: nginx
            name: secret-test
            volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /opt/service-bind
              name: service-bind-volume
          volumes:
          - name: service-bind-volume
            secret:
              defaultMode: 420
              secretName: binding-<service_instance_name>
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    <table>
    <thead>
    <th colspan=2><img src="images/idea.png" alt="Idea icon"/> Understanding the YAML file components</th>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td><code>volumeMounts/mountPath</code></td>
    <td>The name of the secret volume that you want to mount to your container.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>volumes/name</code></td>
    <td>Enter a name for the secret volume that you want to mount to your container.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>secret/defaultMode</code></td>
    <td>Set read-only permissions for the service secret.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>secret/secretName</code></td>
    <td>Enter the name of the secret that you noted earlier.</td>
    </tr></tbody></table>

5.  Create the pod and mount the secret volume.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f <yaml_path>
    ```
    {: pre}

6.  Verify that the pod is created.

    ```
    kubectl get pods --namespace=<my_namespace>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example CLI output:

    ```
    NAME                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    secret-test-1111454598-gfx32   1/1       Running   0          1m
    ```
    {: screen}

7.  Note the **NAME** of your pod.
8.  Get the details about the pod and look for the secret name.

    ```
    kubectl describe pod <pod_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Output:

    ```
    ...
    Volumes:
      service-bind-volume:
        Type:       Secret (a volume populated by a Secret)
        SecretName: binding-<service_instance_name>
    ...
    ```
    {: screen}

    

9.  When implementing your app, configure it to find the secret file named **binding** in the mount directory, parse the JSON content and determine the URL and service credentials to access your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service.

You can now access the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service details and credentials. To work with your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} service, make sure your app is configured to find the service secret file in the mount directory, parse the JSON content and determine the service details.

## Visualizing Kubernetes cluster resources
{: #weavescope}

Weave Scope provides a visual diagram of your resources within a Kubernetes cluster, including services, pods, containers, processes, nodes, and more. Weave Scope provides interactive metrics for CPU and memory and also provides tools to tail and exec into a container.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin:

-   Remember not to expose your cluster information on the public internet. Complete these steps to deploy Weave Scope securely and access it from a web browser locally.
-   If you do not have one already, [create a standard cluster](cs_clusters.html#clusters_ui). Weave Scope can be CPU intensive, especially the app. Run Weave Scope with larger standard clusters, not free clusters.
-   [Target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to your cluster to run `kubectl` commands.


To use Weave Scope with a cluster:
2.  Deploy one of the provided RBAC permissions configuration file in the cluster.

    To enable read/write permissions:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM-Cloud/kube-samples/master/weave-scope/weave-scope-rbac.yaml"
    ```
    {: pre}

    To enable read-only permissions:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM-Cloud/kube-samples/master/weave-scope/weave-scope-rbac-readonly.yaml"
    ```
    {: pre}

    Output:

    ```
    clusterrole "weave-scope-mgr" created
    clusterrolebinding "weave-scope-mgr-role-binding" created
    ```
    {: screen}

3.  Deploy the Weave Scope service, which is privately accessible by the cluster IP address.

    <pre class="pre">
    <code>kubectl apply --namespace kube-system -f "https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/scope.yaml?k8s-version=$(kubectl version | base64 | tr -d '&bsol;n')"</code>
    </pre>

    Output:

    ```
    serviceaccount "weave-scope" created
    deployment "weave-scope-app" created
    service "weave-scope-app" created
    daemonset "weave-scope-agent" created
    ```
    {: screen}

4.  Run a port forwarding command to bring up the service on your computer. Now that Weave Scope is configured with the cluster, to access Weave Scope next time, you can run this port forwarding command without completing the previous configuration steps again.

    ```
    kubectl port-forward -n kube-system "$(kubectl get -n kube-system pod --selector=weave-scope-component=app -o jsonpath='{.items..metadata.name}')" 4040
    ```
    {: pre}

    Output:

    ```
    Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:4040 -> 4040
    Forwarding from [::1]:4040 -> 4040
    Handling connection for 4040
    ```
    {: screen}

5.  Open your web browser to `http://localhost:4040`. Without the default components deployed, you see the following diagram. You can choose to view topology diagrams or tables of the Kubernetes resources in the cluster.
