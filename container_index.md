# Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}
{: #container_index}

Hit the ground running with {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} by deploying highly available apps in Docker containers that run in Kubernetes clusters.
{:shortdesc}

Containers are a standard way to package apps and all their dependencies so that you can seamlessly move the apps between environments. Unlike virtual machines, containers do not bundle the operating system. Only the app code, run time, system tools, libraries, and settings are packaged inside containers. Containers are more lightweight, portable, and efficient than virtual machines.

## Getting started with clusters
{: #clusters}

So you want to deploy an app in a container? Hold on! Start by creating a Kubernetes cluster first. Kubernetes is an orchestration tool for containers. With Kubernetes, developers can deploy highly available apps in a flash by using the power and flexibility of clusters.
{:shortdesc}

And what is a cluster? A cluster is a set of resources, worker nodes, networks, and storage devices that keep apps highly available. After you have your cluster, then you can deploy your apps in containers.

Before you begin, you must have a Trial, Pay-As-You-Go, or Subscription [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account](https://console.bluemix.net/registration/) to create a free cluster.

**What {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account type should I get?** With Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription accounts, you can provision IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) resources for your Kubernetes clusters and create one free cluster or standard clusters. With a Trial account, you can create one free, 21-day cluster but no standard clusters. After 21 days, your free cluster is deleted. To continue with Kubernetes clusters, create another free cluster until your Trial account ends, or upgrade your account to a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription.
{:tip}

To create a free cluster:

1.  From the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} **Catalog** ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/?category=containers) **Containers** category, click **Containers in Kubernetes Clusters**.

2.  Read up on clusters, then click **Create**. Enter a **Cluster Name**. The default cluster type is free. Next time, you can create a standard cluster and define additional customizations, like the number of worker nodes.

3.  Click **Create Cluster**. The details for the cluster open, but the worker node in the cluster takes a few minutes to provision. You can see the status of the worker node in the **Worker nodes** tab. When the status reaches `Ready`, your worker node is ready to be used.

Good work! You created your first Kubernetes cluster. Here are some details about your free cluster:

*   **Machine Type**: The free cluster has one virtual worker node with 2 CPU and 4 GB memory available for your apps to use. When you create a standard cluster, you can choose between physical (bare metal) or virtual machines, along with various machine sizes.
*   **Managed Master**: The worker node is centrally monitored and managed by a dedicated and highly available {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}-owned Kubernetes master that controls and monitors all of the Kubernetes resources in the cluster. You can focus on your worker node and the apps that are deployed in the worker node without worrying about managing this master too.
*   **Infrastructure Resources**: The resources that are required to run the cluster, such as VLANS and IP addresses, are managed in an {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}-owned IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) account. When you create a standard cluster, you manage these resources in your own IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) account. You can learn more about these resources and the [permissions needed](cs_users.html#infra_access) when you create a standard cluster.
*   **Location and Other Options**: Free clusters are deployed within the region that you select, but you cannot choose which location (data center). For more control over location, networking, and persistent storage, create a standard cluster. [Learn more about the benefits of free and standard clusters](cs_why.html#cluster_types).

When the cluster is up and running, start doing something with your cluster.
