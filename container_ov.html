<section role="region" aria-labelledby="d63452e154" id="container_ov__whatis"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d63452e154">What is a container?</h2>
<p>Containers are virtual software objects that include all of the elements that an app needs to
run. A container is built from an image, which is a read-only template for creating the container.
Each image includes just the app and its dependencies, running as an isolated process on the host
operating system. Therefore, a container has the benefits of resource isolation and allocation, but
is more portable and efficient than, for example, a virtual machine. Containers help you build
high-quality apps, fast.</p>
</section><div id="container_ov__benefits"><div class="p"><dl><dt class="dlterm">Containers are agile</dt>
<dd><p>Containers simplify system administration by providing standardized environments for development
and production teams. The engine's lightweight run time enables rapid scale-up and scale-down in
response to changes in demand. They help remove the complexity of managing different operating
system platforms and underlying infrastructure. Containers help you deploy and run any app on any
infrastructure, quickly and reliably. </p>
</dd>
<dt class="dlterm">Containers are small</dt>
<dd><p>You can fit more containers in the amount of space that a single virtual machine would require.
The size of a container can be selected so that you use the amount of space the app requires
only.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="dlterm">Containers are portable</dt>
<dd><p>Build an image for another container by using another image as the base. Let someone else do the bulk of the work on an image and tweak it for your use. You can also migrate app code from a staging environment to a production environment quickly. The migration process can be automated with tools such as the Delivery Pipeline or UrbanCode™ Deploy.</p>

<dt class="dlterm">How do I create a highly available container?</dt>
<dd><span class="keyword">IBM
Cloud Container Service</span> provides single containers
that are similar to Docker containers. In addition, <span class="keyword">IBM
Cloud Container Service</span> provides scalable container groups, that
can be used to make your application highly available. Container groups provide a built-in load
balancer to ensure that the workload is routed and balanced between the container instances. To
increase the availability of your group, spread your container group instances across multiple
physical compute hosts with anti-affinity and enable auto-recovery of unhealthy instances. Also, you
can set policies to auto-scale container group instances based on CPU and memory usage. For more
information, see <a href="container_ha.html#container_ha" title="Highly available containers means less downtime for your app. The more widely you distribute your container setup, the less likely your users are to experience downtime with your app. You can achieve higher availability by using IBM Cloud Container Service built-in capabilities to increase resiliency against potential failure conditions, such as host failures, network failures, or application software failures.">Running highly available processes as container groups (Deprecated)</a>.</dd>
<dt class="dlterm">How do I map container ports to a host port?</dt>
<dd><span class="keyword">IBM
Cloud Container Service</span> differentiates between the
private container network and the public network. On the private container network, all container
ports are exposed by default without additional configuration. Single containers and container
groups that are connected to the same private container network, can communicate by using their
assigned private IP addresses. No port mapping is necessary. <p>To make your app
available to the public network, you must expose a public port, and bind either a public IP address
to your single container, or a public route to your container group. Exposing a public port allows
you to send and receive public data on the exposed port only. All other public ports are closed.</p>

</ul>
</dd>
<dt class="dlterm">What makes the amount of time to build a container different between local Docker and <span class="keyword">Cloud</span>?</dt>
<dd>You might notice that containers build more quickly with your local Docker installation than in
<span class="keyword">Cloud</span>. With the first deployment, the
container image must be downloaded to the registry on the host. Subsequent deployments of the image
are faster. For more information about how deployment speeds are impacted by the different container
configurations, see <a href="container_planning.html#container_planning_types" title="Before you create a container with IBM Cloud Container Service, decide on the type of container that you need. IBM Cloud Container Service offers different approaches to create containers in the cloud. The approach that you choose depends on the requirements and dependencies of your app that runs in your container.">Container types</a>.</dd>
<dt class="dlterm">How do I create a container on a private network and not expose it publicly?</dt>
<dd>When you create a container, it is connected to the <span class="keyword">IBM
Cloud Container Service</span> default container private network and a
private IP address is assigned to your container. On this private network, all container ports are
exposed by default. No mapping of host ports to container ports is necessary. To prevent a container
from being accessible from the Internet, do not bind an IP address or expose a port when you create
the container.</dd>
<dt class="dlterm">How do I mount a volume to a container?</dt>
<dd>A single container is, by design, short-lived. However, you can use a volume to persist data
between container restarts. When you mount a volume in Docker, the volume is mounted to your local
file system. In <span class="keyword">IBM
Cloud Container Service</span>, the access to
the compute host is restricted, so you cannot mount host directories to a container. Instead,
organization-scoped volumes are used to persist data between container restarts. Volumes are hosted
on isolated file shares that securely store app data and manage the access and permission to the
files. To mount a volume to a container, you must <a href="container_volumes_ov.html#container_volumes_ui" title="A volume is a persistent storage location for the data that an app creates or the files that the app requires to run. You can create a volume for your container from the Cloud GUI.">create a volume</a> first. When you create a container from the CLI, mount an
existing volume by using the <samp class="ph codeph">--volume</samp> option. From the <span class="keyword">Cloud</span> GUI select the <span class="ph uicontrol">Advanced
options</span> and assign an existing volume. For more information, see <a href="container_volumes_ov.html#container_volumes_mount" title="After you create a volume, you can mount the volume to a container and add files that are accessible by any container the volume is mounted to.">Adding files to volumes with the command line interface (CLI)</a>.</dd>

<dt class="dlterm">Why are my containers running in detached mode?</dt>

run in detached mode to allow containers with running processes to run in the background without
