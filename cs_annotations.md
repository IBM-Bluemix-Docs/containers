## Additional client request or response header (proxy-add-headers)
{: #proxy-add-headers}

Add extra header information to a client request before sending the request to the back-end app or to a client response before sending the response to the client.
{:shortdesc}

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>The Ingress application load balancer acts as a proxy between the client app and your back-end app. Client requests that are sent to the application load balancer are processed (proxied) and put into a new request that is then sent from the application load balancer to your back-end app. Proxying a request removes http header information, such as the user name, that was initially sent from the client. If your back-end app requires this information, you can use the <strong>ingress.bluemix.net/proxy-add-headers</strong> annotation to add header information to the client request before the request is forwarded from the application load balancer to your back-end app.

</br></br>
When a back-end app sends a response to the client, the response is proxied by the application load balancer and http headers are removed from the response. The client web app might require this header information to successfully process the response. You can use the <strong>ingress.bluemix.net/response-add-headers</strong> annotation to add header information to the client response before the response is forwarded from the application load balancer to client web app.</dd>

 ## Client response data buffering (proxy-buffering)
 {: #proxy-buffering}

 Use the buffer annotation to disable the storage of response data on the application load balancer while the data is sent to the client.
 {:shortdesc}

 <dl>
 <dt>Description</dt>
 <dd>The Ingress application load balancer acts as a proxy between your back-end app and the client web browser. When a response is sent from the back-end app to the client, the response data is buffered on the application load balancer by default. The application load balancer proxies the client response and starts sending the response to the client at the client's pace. After all data from the back-end app is received by the application load balancer, the connection to the back-end app is closed. The connection from the application load balancer to the client remains open until the client receives all data.

 </br></br>
 If buffering of response data on the application load balancer is disabled, data is immediately sent from the application load balancer to the client. The client must be able to handle incoming data at the pace of the application load balancer. If the client is too slow, data might get lost.
 </br></br>
 Response data buffering on the application load balancer is enabled by default.</dd>

 ## Client response header removal (response-remove-headers)

Remove header information that is included in the client response from the back-end end app before the response is sent to the client.
 {:shortdesc}

 <dl>
 <dt>Description</dt>
 <dd>The Ingress application load balancer acts as a proxy between your back-end app and the client web browser. Client responses from the back-end app that are sent to the application load balancer are processed (proxied), and put into a new response that is then sent from the application load balancer to the client web browser. Although proxying a response removes http header information that was initially sent from the back-end app, this process might not remove all back-end app specific headers. Remove header information from a client reponse before the response is forwarded from the application load balancer to the client web browser.</dd>

## Custom connect-timeouts and read-timeouts (proxy-connect-timeout, proxy-read-timeout)
{: #proxy-connect-timeout}

Set a custom connect-timeout and read-timeout for the application load balancer. Adjust the time for the application load balancer to wait while connecting and reading from the back-end app before the back-end app is considered to be unavailable.
{:shortdesc}

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>When a client request is sent to the Ingress application load balancer, a connection to the back-end app is opened by the application load balancer. By default, the application load balancer waits 60 seconds to receive a reply from the back-end app. If the back-end app does not reply within 60 seconds, then the connection request is aborted and the back-end app is considered to be unavailable.

</br></br>
After the application load balancer is connected to the back-end app, response data is read from the back-end app by the application load balancer. During this read operation, the application load balancer waits a maximum of 60 seconds between two read operations to receive data from the back-end app. If the back-end app does not send data within 60 seconds, the connection to the back-end app is closed and the app is considered to be not available.
</br></br>
A 60 second connect-timeout and read-timeout is the default timeout on a proxy and usually should not be changed.
</br></br>
If the availability of your app is not steady or your app is slow to respond because of high workloads, you might want to increase the connect-timeout or read-timeout. Keep in mind that increasing the timeout impacts the performance of the application load balancer as the connection to the back-end app must stay open until the timeout is reached.
</br></br>
On the other hand, you can decrease the timeout to gain performance on the application load balancer. Ensure that your back-end app is able to handle requests within the specified timeout, even during higher workloads.</dd>

## Custom maximum client request body size (client-max-body-size)
{: #client-max-body-size}

Adjust the maximum size of the body that the client can send as part of a request.
{:shortdesc}

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>To maintain the expected performance, the maximum client request body size is set to 1 megabyte. When a client request with a body size over the limit is sent to the Ingress application load balancer, and the client does not allow data to be divided, the application load balancer returns a 413 (Request Entity Too Large) http response to the client. A connection between the client and the application load balancer is not possible until the size of the request body is reduced. When the client allows data to be split up into multiple chunks, data is divided into packages of 1 megabyte and sent to the application load balancer.

</br></br>
You might want to increase the maximum body size because you expect client requests with a body size that is greater than 1 megabyte. For example, you want your client to be able to upload large files. Increasing the maximum request body size might impact the performance of your application load balancer because the connection to the client must stay open until the request is received.
</br></br>
<strong>Note:</strong> Some client web browsers cannot display the 413 http response message properly.</dd>

## Session-affinity with cookies (sticky-cookie-services)
{: #sticky-cookie-services}

Use the sticky cookie annotation to add session affinity to your application load balancer and always route incoming network traffic to the same upstream server.
{:shortdesc}

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>For high availability, some app setups require you to deploy multiple upstream servers that handle incoming client requests. When a client connects to you back-end app, you can use session-affinity so that a client is served by the same upstream server for the duration of a session or for the time it takes to complete a task. You can configure your application load balancer to ensure session-affinity by always routing incoming network traffic to the same upstream server.

</br></br>
Every client that connects to your back-end app is assigned to one of the available upstream servers by the application load balancer. The application load balancer creates a session cookie that is stored in the client's app, which is included in the header information of every request between the application load balancer and the client. The information in the cookie ensures that all requests are handled by the same upstream server throughout the session.

  For every Kubernetes service, you can define an individual path that is appended to the IBM-provided domain to create a unique path to your app, for example <code>ingress_domain/myservicepath1</code>. When you enter this route into a web browser, network traffic is routed to the application load balancer. The application load balancer looks up the associated service and sends network traffic to the service and to the pods where the app is running by using the same path. The app must be set up to listen on this path in order to receive incoming network traffic.

  </br></br>
  Many apps do not listen on a specific path but use the root path and a specific port. In this case, define the root path as <code>/</code> and do not specify an individual path for your app.
  </br>
  Examples: <ul><li>For <code>http://ingress_host_name/</code>, enter <code>/</code> as the path.</li><li>For <code>http://ingress_host_name/myservicepath</code>, enter <code>/myservicepath</code> as the path.</li></ul>

### SSL Services support with authentication
{: #ssl-services-auth}

Allow HTTPS requests and encrypt traffic to your upstream apps with one-way or mutual authentication for additional security.
{:shortdesc}

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>
Configure mutual authentication for load balancing apps that require HTTPS with the Ingress controllers.

**Note**: Before you begin, [convert the cert and key into base-64 ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.base64encode.org/).

  <td>Replace <em>&lt;myservicepath&gt;</em> with a slash or the unique path that your app is listening on, so that network traffic can be forwarded to the app.

  </br>
  For every Kubernetes service, you can define an individual path that is appended to the IBM-provided domain to create a unique path to your app, for example <code>ingress_domain/myservicepath1</code>. When you enter this route into a web browser, network traffic is routed to the application load balancer. The application load balancer looks up the associated service, and sends network traffic to the service and to the pods where the app is running by using the same path. The app must be set up to listen on this path in order to receive incoming network traffic.

  </br></br>
  Many apps do not listen on a specific path, but use the root path and a specific port. In this case, define the root path as <code>/</code> and do not specify an individual path for your app.
  </br>
  Examples: <ul><li>For <code>http://ingress_host_name/</code>, enter <code>/</code> as the path.</li><li>For <code>http://ingress_host_name/myservicepath</code>, enter <code>/myservicepath</code> as the path.</li></ul>
  </br>
  <strong>Tip:</strong> To configure your Ingress to listen on a path that is different to the one that your app listens on, you can use the <a href="#rewrite-path" target="_blank">rewrite annotation</a> to establish proper routing to your app.</td>
