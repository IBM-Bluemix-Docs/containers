<span class="keyword">Cloud</span> space and
<samp class="ph codeph">docker</samp> commands are used to manage containers locally. <samp class="ph codeph">docker</samp>
commands are always required for local image development though. </p>
<p>For example, with Option 1,
the <samp class="ph codeph"><span class="ph"><samp class="ph codeph">bx ic</samp></span> run</samp> command creates a
container in your <span class="keyword">Cloud</span> space and

<li>The size of the image has a significant impact. The smaller the image, the quicker the
deployment.</li>
<li>After the first few times an image is deployed, deployment speeds improve. Initially, the image
must be downloaded to the registry on the host. Subsequent deployments are faster. </li>
<li>The networking setup might take a few minutes.</li>

<p>To configure a multi-container deployment with Docker Compose, see <a href="container_single_ui.html#container_compose_intro" title="If you have apps with multiple components, such as databases, services and caches, orchestrating all containers to start up and shut down together, can be a hard thing to do. In this tutorial, you learn how to deploy and run your app as a multi-container deployment in a microservices architecture by using a single Docker Compose command. Each container that is part of this system, is based on a Docker Compose service definition, and runs in its own isolated environment.">Tutorial: Creating a multi-container deployment with Docker Compose and IBM Cloud Container Service</a>. </p>

<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">In <span class="keyword">Cloud</span>,
containers come with built-in monitoring and logging, so you can watch the health of your containers
closely.</p>
<div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> This service is not intended for processing sensitive data.</div>
<p><span class="keyword">IBM
Cloud</span> offers platform-based
monitoring and logging capabilities. Metric and log data can be collected from compute instances,
like containers, that are running in the cloud and from other sources. Aggregated data from multiple
sources can then be visualized for analysis, insights, and action.</p>

<dd><span class="ph" id="container_planning_monlog__monitoring">Container metrics are collected from outside of the container, without
having to install and maintain agents inside of the container. In-container agents can have
significant overheads and setup times for short-lived, lightweight cloud instances and auto-scaling
groups, where containers can be rapidly created and destroyed. This out-of-band data collection
approach eliminates these challenges and removes the burden of monitoring from the users.</span></dd>
<dd class="ddexpand" id="container_planning_monlog__default_metrics"><p>A process that is running in the host performs agentless monitoring for metrics. This process,
which is also called the <dfn class="term">crawler</dfn>, constantly collects the following information from
all of the containers.</p>

<div class="p"><ul><li>CPU</li>
<li>Memory </li>
<li>Network information</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>This metric data is collected in Graphite and is displayed in both the <span class="keyword">Cloud</span> user interface and the Advanced
monitoring view. Docker conventions and groups accounting information are used as the basic
mechanism for the collection of monitoring data.</p>

<p>You can see a list of plug-ins that are installed to collect the data in
<span class="ph filepath">/etc/collectd/collectd.conf</span>. To learn more about what those plug-ins do, see
the <a href="https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd.conf.5.shtml" rel="external" target="_blank" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">collectd documentation</a>.</p>

<dl><dt class="dlterm">Logging</dt>
<dd><span class="ph" id="container_planning_monlog__logging">Similar to metrics, container logs are monitored and forwarded from outside of
the container by using crawlers. The data is sent by the crawlers to a multi-tenant <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch" rel="external" target="_blank" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">Elasticsearch</a> in <span class="keyword">IBM
Cloud</span>, just like
logs that are collected by other in-container agents, but without the hassle of having to install
the agents inside the container.</span></dd>
<dd class="ddexpand"><p>The crawlers retrieve information from these locations by default.</p>
<ul id="container_planning_monlog__default_logs"><li><span class="ph filepath">/var/log/messages</span>: System messages.</li>
<li><span class="ph filepath">/docker.log</span>: The Docker logs. <p>The Docker log file is not stored as a
file inside of the container, but it is collected anyway. This log file is collected by default as
it is the standard Docker convention for exposing the <samp class="ph codeph">stdout</samp> (standard output) and
<samp class="ph codeph">stderr</samp> (standard error) information for the container. If any container process
prints to <samp class="ph codeph">stdout</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">stderr</samp>, that information is collected.</p>
</li>
</ul>
To collect additional logs, add the <samp class="ph codeph">LOG_LOCATIONS</samp> environment variable with a
path to the log file when creating your container in the <a href="container_single_ui.html#gui__env_keys_group">GUI</a> or the
<a href="container_single_ui.html#container_single_cli" title="Create a container by using the run command. A container must include an image in it. If you do not have one yet, you can use one of the default IBM certified images that are available by default in your organization's private images registry.">CLI</a>.</dd>
