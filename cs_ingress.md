# Setting up Ingress services
{: #ingress}

## Configuring access to an app by using Ingress
{: #config}

Expose multiple apps in your Kubernetes cluster by creating Ingress resources that are managed by the IBM-provided application load balancer in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}.
{:shortdesc}

An application load balancer is an external HTTP or HTTPS load balancer that uses a secured and unique public or private entrypoint to route incoming requests to your apps inside or outside your cluster. With Ingress, you can define individual routing rules for every app that you expose to the public or to private networks. For general information about Ingress services, see [Planning external networking with Ingress](cs_network_planning.html#ingress).

**Note:** Ingress is available for standard clusters only and requires at least two worker nodes in the cluster to ensure high availability and that periodic updates are applied. Setting up Ingress requires an [Administrator access policy](cs_users.html#access_policies). Verify your current [access policy](cs_users.html#infra_access).

To choose the best configuration for Ingress, you can follow this decision tree:

## Exposing apps to the public
{: #ingress_expose_public}

When you create a standard cluster, an IBM-provided application load balancer is automatically enabled and is assigned a portable public IP address and a public route.
{:shortdesc}

Every app that is exposed to the public via Ingress is assigned a unique path that is appended to the public route, so that you can use a unique URL to access an app publicly in your cluster. To expose your app to the public, you can configure Ingress for the following scenarios.

-   [Publicly expose apps using the IBM-provided domain without TLS](#ibm_domain)
-   [Publicly expose apps using the IBM-provided domain with TLS](#ibm_domain_cert)
-   [Publicly expose apps using a custom domain with TLS](#custom_domain_cert)
-   [Publicly expose apps that are outside your cluster using the IBM-provided or a custom domain with TLS](#external_endpoint)

### Publicly expose apps using the IBM-provided domain without TLS
{: #ibm_domain}

You can configure the application load balancer to load balance incoming HTTP network traffic to the apps in your cluster and use the IBM-provided domain to access your apps from the internet.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin:

-   If you do not have one already, [create a standard cluster](cs_clusters.html#clusters_ui).
-   [Target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to your cluster to run `kubectl` commands.

To expose an app by using the IBM-provided domain:

1.  [Deploy your app to the cluster](cs_app.html#app_cli). When you deploy your app to the cluster, one or more pods are created for you that run your app in a container. Ensure that you add a label to your deployment in the metadata section of your configuration file. This label is needed to identify all pods where your app is running, so that they can be included in the Ingress load balancing.
2.  Create a Kubernetes service for the app to expose. The application load balancer can include your app into the Ingress load balancing only if your app is exposed via a Kubernetes service inside the cluster.
    1.  Open your preferred editor and create a service configuration file that is named, for example, `myservice.yaml`.
    2.  Define an application load balancer service for the app that you want to expose to the public.

        ```
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        metadata:
          name: <myservice>
        spec:
          selector:
            <selectorkey>: <selectorvalue>
          ports:
           - protocol: TCP
             port: 8080
        ```
        {: codeblock}

        <th colspan=2><img src="images/idea.png" alt="Idea icon"/> Understanding the YAML file components</th>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td><code>name</code></td>
        <td>Replace <em>&lt;myservice&gt;</em> with a name for your application load balancer service.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><code>selector</code></td>
        <td>Enter the label key (<em>&lt;selectorkey&gt;</em>) and value (<em>&lt;selectorvalue&gt;</em>) pair that you want to use to target the pods where your app runs. For example, if you use the following selector <code>app: code</code>, all pods that have this label in their metadata are included in the load balancing. Enter the same label that you used when you deployed your app to the cluster. </td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
         <td><code>port</code></td>
         <td>The port that the service listens on.</td>
         </tr>
         </tbody></table>
    3.  Save your changes.
    4.  Create the service in your cluster.

        ```
        kubectl apply -f myservice.yaml
        ```
        {: pre}
    5.  Repeat these steps for every app that you want to expose to the public.
3.  Get the details for your cluster to view the IBM-provided domain. Replace _&lt;mycluster&gt;_ with the name of the cluster where the app is deployed that you want to expose to the public.

    ```
    bx cs cluster-get <mycluster>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Your CLI output looks similar to the following.

    ```
    Retrieving cluster <mycluster>...
    OK
    Name:    <mycluster>
    ID:    b9c6b00dc0aa487f97123440b4895f2d

    Ingress subdomain:  <ibmdomain>
    Ingress secret:  <ibmtlssecret>
    Workers:  3
    ```
    {: screen}

    You can see the IBM-provided domain in the **Ingress subdomain** field.
4.  Create an Ingress resource. Ingress resources define the routing rules for the Kubernetes service that you created for your app and are used by the application load balancer to route incoming network traffic to the service. You must use one Ingress resource to define routing rules for multiple apps if every app is exposed via a Kubernetes service inside the cluster.
    1.  Open your preferred editor and create an Ingress configuration file that is named, for example, `myingress.yaml`.
    2.  Define an Ingress resource in your configuration file that uses the IBM-provided domain to route incoming network traffic to the service that you created earlier.

        ```
        apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
        kind: Ingress
        metadata:
          name: <myingressname>
        spec:
          rules:
          - host: <ibmdomain>
            http:
              paths:
              - path: /<myservicepath1>
                backend:
                  serviceName: <myservice1>
                  servicePort: 80
              - path: /<myservicepath2>
                backend:
                  serviceName: <myservice2>
                  servicePort: 80
        ```
        {: codeblock}

        <table>
        <caption>Understanding the Ingress resource file components</caption>
        <thead>
        <th colspan=2><img src="images/idea.png" alt="Idea icon"/> Understanding the YAML file components</th>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td><code>name</code></td>
        <td>Replace <em>&lt;myingressname&gt;</em> with a name for your Ingress resource.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><code>host</code></td>
        <td>Replace <em>&lt;ibmdomain&gt;</em> with the IBM-provided <strong>Ingress subdomain</strong> name from the previous step.

        </br></br>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Do not use * for your host or leave the host property empty to avoid failures during Ingress creation.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><code>path</code></td>
        <td>Replace <em>&lt;myservicepath1&gt;</em> with a slash or the unique path that your app is listening on, so that network traffic can be forwarded to the app.

        </br>
        For every Kubernetes service, you can define an individual path that is appended to the IBM-provided domain to create a unique path to your app, for example <code>ingress_domain/myservicepath1</code>. When you enter this route into a web browser, network traffic is routed to the application load balancer. The application load balancer looks up the associated service, and sends network traffic to the service and to the pods where the app is running by using the same path. The app must be set up to listen on this path in order to receive incoming network traffic.

        </br></br>
        Many apps do not listen on a specific path, but use the root path and a specific port. In this case, define the root path as <code>/</code> and do not specify an individual path for your app.
        </br>
        Examples: <ul><li>For <code>http://ingress_host_name/</code>, enter <code>/</code> as the path.</li><li>For <code>http://ingress_host_name/myservicepath</code>, enter <code>/myservicepath</code> as the path.</li></ul>
        </br>
        <strong>Tip:</strong> If you want to configure your Ingress to listen on a path that is different to the one that your app listens on, you can use the [rewrite annotation](cs_annotations.html#rewrite-path) to establish proper routing to your app.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><code>serviceName</code></td>
        <td>Replace <em>&lt;myservice1&gt;</em> with the name of the service that you used when you created the Kubernetes service for your app.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><code>servicePort</code></td>
        <td>The port that your service listens to. Use the same port that you defined when you created the Kubernetes service for your app.</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody></table>

    3.  Create the Ingress resource for your cluster.

        ```
        kubectl apply -f myingress.yaml
        ```
        {: pre}

5.  Verify that the Ingress resource was created successfully. Replace _&lt;myingressname&gt;_ with the name of the Ingress resource that you created earlier.

    ```
    kubectl describe ingress <myingressname>
    ```
    {: pre}

  **Note:** It might take a few minutes for the Ingress resource to be created and for the app to be available on the public internet.
6.  In a web browser, enter the URL of the app service to access.

    ```
    http://<ibmdomain>/<myservicepath1>
    ```
    {: codeblock}

### Publicly expose apps using the IBM-provided domain with TLS
{: #ibm_domain_cert}

You can configure the Ingress control to manage incoming TLS connections for your apps, decrypt the network traffic by using the IBM-provided TLS certificate, and forward the unencrypted request to the apps that are exposed in your cluster.

4.  Create an Ingress resource. Ingress resources define the routing rules for the Kubernetes service that you created for your app and are used by the application load balancer to route incoming network traffic to the service.

When you enter this route into a web browser, network traffic is routed to the application load balancer. The application load balancer looks up the associated service and sends network traffic to the service, and further to the pods where the app is running.

        **Note:** Your app must listen on the path that you defined in the Ingress resource. Otherwise, network traffic cannot be forwarded to the app. Most apps do not listen on a specific path, but use the root path and a specific port. In this case, define the root path as `/` and do not specify an individual path for your app.

### Publicly expose apps using a custom domain with TLS
{: #custom_domain_cert}

You can configure the application load balancer to route incoming network traffic to the apps in your cluster and use your own TLS certificate to manage the TLS termination, while using your custom domain rather than the IBM-provided domain.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin:

-   If you do not have one already, [create a standard cluster](cs_clusters.html#clusters_ui).
-   [Target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to your cluster to run `kubectl` commands.

To expose an app by using a custom domain with TLS:

1.  Create a custom domain. To create a custom domain, work with your Domain Name Service (DNS) provider to register your custom domain.
2.  Configure your domain to route incoming network traffic to the IBM-provided application load balancer. Choose between these options:
    -   Define an alias for your custom domain by specifying the IBM-provided domain as a Canonical Name record (CNAME). To find the IBM-provided Ingress domain, run `bx cs cluster-get <mycluster>` and look for the **Ingress subdomain** field.
    -   Map your custom domain to the portable public IP address of the IBM-provided application load balancer by adding the IP address as a record. To find the portable public IP address of the application load balancer, run `bx cs alb-get <public_alb_ID>`.
3.  Either import or create a TLS certificate and key secret:
    * If you already have a TLS certificate stored in {{site.data.keyword.cloudcerts_long_notm}} that you want to use, you can import its associated secret into your cluster by running the following command:

      ```
      bx cs alb-cert-deploy --secret-name <secret_name> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --cert-crn <certificate_crn>
      ```
      {: pre}

    * If you do not have a TLS certificate ready, follow these steps:
        1. Create a TLS certificate and key for your domain that is encoded in PEM format.
        2.  Open your preferred editor and create a Kubernetes secret configuration file that is named, for example, `mysecret.yaml`.
        3.  Define a secret that uses your TLS certificate and key. Replace <em>&lt;mytlssecret&gt;</em> with a name for your Kubernetes secret, <em>&lt;tls_key_filepath&gt;</em> with the path to your custom TLS key file, and <em>&lt;tls_cert_filepath&gt;</em> with the path to your custom TLS certificate file.

            ```
            kubectl create secret tls <mytlssecret> --key <tls_key_filepath> --cert <tls_cert_filepath>
            ```
            {: pre}

        4.  Save your configuration file.
        5.  Create the TLS secret for your cluster.

            ```
            kubectl apply -f mysecret.yaml
            ```
            {: pre}

4.  [Deploy your app to the cluster](cs_app.html#app_cli). When you deploy your app to the cluster, one or more pods are created for you that run your app in a container. Ensure that you add a label to your deployment in the metadata section of your configuration file. This label is needed to identify all pods where your app is running, so that they can be included in the Ingress load balancing.

5.  Create a Kubernetes service for the app to expose. The application load balancer can include your app into the Ingress load balancing only if your app is exposed via a Kubernetes service inside the cluster.

    1.  Open your preferred editor and create a service configuration file that is named, for example, `myservice.yaml`.
    2.  Define an application load balancer service for the app that you want to expose to the public.

        ```
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        metadata:
          name: <myservice>
        spec:
          selector:
            <selectorkey>: <selectorvalue>
          ports:
           - protocol: TCP
             port: 8080
        ```
       {: codeblock}

        <table>
        <caption>Understanding the application load balancer service file components</caption>
        <thead>
        <th colspan=2><img src="images/idea.png" alt="Idea icon"/> Understanding the YAML file components</th>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td><code>name</code></td>
        <td>Replace <em>&lt;myservice1&gt;</em> with a name for your application load balancer service.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><code>selector</code></td>
        <td>Enter the label key (<em>&lt;selectorkey&gt;</em>) and value (<em>&lt;selectorvalue&gt;</em>) pair that you want to use to target the pods where your app runs. For example, if you use the following selector <code>app: code</code>, all pods that have this label in their metadata are included in the load balancing. Enter the same label that you used when you deployed your app to the cluster. </td>
         </tr>
         <td><code>port</code></td>
         <td>The port that the service listens on.</td>
         </tbody></table>

    3.  Save your changes.
    4.  Create the service in your cluster.

        ```
        kubectl apply -f myservice.yaml
        ```
        {: pre}

    5.  Repeat these steps for every app that you want to expose to the public.
6.  Create an Ingress resource. Ingress resources define the routing rules for the Kubernetes service that you created for your app and are used by the application load balancer to route incoming network traffic to the service. You must use one Ingress resource to define routing rules for multiple apps if every app is exposed via a Kubernetes service inside the cluster.
    1.  Open your preferred editor and create an Ingress configuration file that is named, for example, `myingress.yaml`.
    2.  Define an Ingress resource in your configuration file that uses your custom domain to route incoming network traffic to your services, and your custom certificate to manage the TLS termination. For every service you can define an individual path that is appended to your custom domain to create a unique path to your app, for example `https://mydomain/myapp`. When you enter this route into a web browser, network traffic is routed to the application load balancer. The application load balancer looks up the associated service and sends network traffic to the service, and further to the pods where the app is running.

        **Note:** It is important that the app listens on the path that you defined in the Ingress resource. Otherwise, network traffic cannot be forwarded to the app. Most apps do not listen on a specific path, but use the root path and a specific port. In this case, define the root path as `/` and do not specify an individual path for your app.

        ```
        apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
        kind: Ingress
        metadata:
          name: <myingressname>
        spec:
          tls:
          - hosts:
            - <mycustomdomain>

                  servicePort: 80
              - path: /<myservicepath2>
                backend:
                  serviceName: <myservice2>
                  servicePort: 80
        ```
        {: codeblock}

        <td>Replace <em>&lt;myservicepath1&gt;</em> with a slash or the unique path that your app is listening on, so that network traffic can be forwarded to the app.

        </br>
        For every Kubernetes service, you can define an individual path that is appended to the IBM-provided domain to create a unique path to your app, for example <code>ingress_domain/myservicepath1</code>. When you enter this route into a web browser, network traffic is routed to the application load balancer. The application load balancer looks up the associated service, and sends network traffic to the service and to the pods where the app is running by using the same path. The app must be set up to listen on this path in order to receive incoming network traffic.

        </br>
        Many apps do not listen on a specific path, but use the root path and a specific port. In this case, define the root path as <code>/</code> and do not specify an individual path for your app.

        </br></br>
        Examples: <ul><li>For <code>https://mycustomdomain/</code>, enter <code>/</code> as the path.</li><li>For <code>https://mycustomdomain/myservicepath</code>, enter <code>/myservicepath</code> as the path.</li></ul>
        <strong>Tip:</strong> If you want to configure your Ingress to listen on a path that is different to the one that your app listens on, you can use the [rewrite annotation](cs_annotations.html#rewrite-path) to establish proper routing to your app.

        ```
        kubectl apply -f myingress.yaml

7.  Verify that the Ingress resource was created successfully. Replace _&lt;myingressname&gt;_ with the name of the Ingress resource that you created earlier.

    ```
    kubectl describe ingress <myingressname>
    ```
    {: pre}

    **Note:** It might take a few minutes for the Ingress resource to be created properly and for the app to be available on the public internet.

8.  Access your app from the internet.
    1.  Open your preferred web browser.

### Publicly expose apps that are outside your cluster using the IBM-provided or a custom domain with TLS
{: #external_endpoint}

You can configure the application load balancer to include apps that are located outside your cluster. Incoming requests on the IBM-provided or your custom domain are forwarded automatically to the external app.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin:

-   If you do not have one already, [create a standard cluster](cs_clusters.html#clusters_ui).
-   [Target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to your cluster to run `kubectl` commands.
-   Ensure that the external app that you want to include into the cluster load balancing can be accessed by using a public IP address.

You can route incoming network traffic on the IBM-provided domain to apps that are located outside your cluster. If you want to use a custom domain and TLS certificate instead, replace the IBM-provided domain and TLS certificate with your [custom domain and TLS certificate](#custom_domain_cert).

1.  Create a Kubernetes service for your cluster that will forward incoming requests to an external endpoint that you will created.
    1.  Open your preferred editor and create a service configuration file that is named, for example, `myexternalservice.yaml`.
    2.  Define the application load balancer service.

        ```
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        metadata:
          name: <myservicename>
        spec:
          ports:
           - protocol: TCP
             port: 8080
        ```
        {: codeblock}

        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td><code>metadata/name</code></td>
        <td>Replace <em>&lt;myservicename&gt;</em> with a name for your service.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><code>port</code></td>
        <td>The port that the service listens on.</td>
        </tr></tbody></table>

    3.  Save your changes.
    4.  Create the Kubernetes service for your cluster.

        ```
        kubectl apply -f myexternalservice.yaml
        ```
        {: pre}

2.  Configure a Kubernetes endpoint that defines the external location of the app that you want to include into the cluster load balancing.
    1.  Open your preferred editor and create an endpoint configuration file that is named, for example, `myexternalendpoint.yaml`.
    2.  Define your external endpoint. Include all public IP addresses and ports that you can use to access your external app.

        ```
        kind: Endpoints
        apiVersion: v1
        metadata:
          name: <myservicename>
        subsets:
          - addresses:
              - ip: <externalIP1>
              - ip: <externalIP2>
            ports:
              - port: <externalport>
        ```
        {: codeblock}

        <table>
        <thead>
        <th colspan=2><img src="images/idea.png" alt="Idea icon"/> Understanding the YAML file components</th>
        </thead>

        <tr>
        <td><code>name</code></td>
        <td>Replace <em>&lt;myendpointname&gt;</em> with the name of the Kubernetes service that you created earlier.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><code>ip</code></td>
        <td>Replace <em>&lt;externalIP&gt;</em> with the public IP addresses to connect to your external app.</td>
         </tr>
         <td><code>port</code></td>
         <td>Replace <em>&lt;externalport&gt;</em> with the port that your external app listens to.</td>
         </tbody></table>

    3.  Save your changes.
    4.  Create the Kubernetes endpoint for your cluster.

        ```
        kubectl apply -f myexternalendpoint.yaml
        ```
        {: pre}

3.  View the IBM-provided domain and TLS certificate. Replace _&lt;mycluster&gt;_ with the name of the cluster where the app is deployed.

    ```
    bx cs cluster-get <mycluster>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Your CLI output looks similar to the following.

    ```
    Retrieving cluster <mycluster>...
    OK
    Name:    <mycluster>
    ID:    b9c6b00dc0aa487f97123440b4895f2d

    Ingress subdomain:  <ibmdomain>
    Ingress secret:  <ibmtlssecret>
    Workers:  3
    ```
    {: screen}

    You can see the IBM-provided domain in the **Ingress subdomain** and the IBM-provided certificate in the **Ingress secret** field.

4.  Create an Ingress resource. Ingress resources define the routing rules for the Kubernetes service that you created for your app and are used by the application load balancer to route incoming network traffic to the service. You can use one Ingress resource to define routing rules for multiple external apps as long as every app is exposed with its external endpoint via a Kubernetes service inside the cluster.
    1.  Open your preferred editor and create an Ingress configuration file that is named, for example, `myexternalingress.yaml`.
    2.  Define an Ingress resource in your configuration file that uses the IBM-provided domain and TLS certificate to route incoming network traffic to your external app by using the external endpoint that you defined earlier. For every service you can define an individual path that is appended to the IBM-provided or custom domain to create a unique path to your app, for example `https://ingress_domain/myapp`. When you enter this route into a web browser, network traffic is routed to the application load balancer. The application load balancer looks up the associated service and sends network traffic to the service, and further to the external app.

        **Note:** It is important that the app listens on the path that you defined in the Ingress resource. Otherwise, network traffic cannot be forwarded to the app. Most apps do not listen on a specific path, but use the root path and a specific port. In this case, define the root path as / and do not specify an individual path for your app.

        ```
        apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
        kind: Ingress
        metadata:
          name: <myingressname>

## Exposing apps to a private network
{: #ingress_expose_private}

When you create a standard cluster, an IBM-provided application load balancer is created and assigned a portable private IP address and a private route. However, the default private application load balancer is not automatically enabled. To expose your app to private networks, first [enable the default private application load balancer](#private_ingress).
{:shortdesc}

You can then configure Ingress for the following scenarios.
-   [Privately expose apps using a custom domain without TLS](#private_ingress_no_tls)
-   [Privately expose apps using a custom domain with TLS](#private_ingress_tls)

### Enabling the default private application load balancer
{: #private_ingress}

Before you can use the default private application load balancer, you must enable it with either the IBM-provided portable private IP address or your own portable private IP address.
{:shortdesc}

**Note**: If you used the `--no-subnet` flag when you created the cluster, then you must add a portable private subnet or a user-managed subnet before you can enable the private application load balancer. For more information, see [Requesting additional subnets for your cluster](cs_subnets.html#request).

Before you begin:

-   If you do not have one already, [create a standard cluster](cs_clusters.html#clusters_ui).
-   [Target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to your cluster.

To enable the private application load balancer using the pre-assigned, IBM-provided portable private IP address:

1. List the available application load balancers in your cluster to get the ID of the private application load balancer. Replace <em>&lt;cluser_name&gt;</em> with the name of the cluster where the app that you want to expose is deployed.

    ```
    bx cs albs --cluster <my_cluster>
    ```
    {: pre}

    The field **Status** for the private application load balancer is _disabled_.
    ```
    ALB ID                                            Enabled   Status     Type      ALB IP
    private-cr6d779503319d419ea3b4ab171d12c3b8-alb1   false     disabled   private   -
    public-cr6d779503319d419ea3b4ab171d12c3b8-alb1    true      enabled    public    169.46.63.150
    ```
    {: screen}

2. Enable the private application load balancer. Replace <em>&lt;private_ALB_ID&gt;</em> with the ID for private application load balancer from the output in the previous step.

   ```
   bx cs bx cs alb-configure --albID <private_ALB_ID> --enable
   ```

To enable the private application load balancer using your own portable private IP address:

1. Configure the user-managed subnet of your chosen IP address to route traffic on the private VLAN of your cluster. Replace <em>&lt;cluser_name&gt;</em> with the name or ID of the cluster where the app that you want to expose is deployed, <em>&lt;subnet_CIDR&gt;</em> with the CIDR of your user-managed subnet, and <em>&lt;private_VLAN&gt;</em> with an available private VLAN ID. You can find the ID of an available private VLAN by running `bx cs vlans`.

   ```
   bx cs cluster-user-subnet-add <cluster_name> <subnet_CIDR> <private_VLAN>
   ```
   {: pre}

2. List the available application load balancers in your cluster to get the ID of private application load balancer.

    ```
    bx cs albs --cluster <my_cluster>
    ```
    {: pre}

    The field **Status** for the private application load balancer is _disabled_.
    ```
    ALB ID                                            Enabled   Status     Type      ALB IP

    ```
    {: screen}

3. Enable the private application load balancer. Replace <em>&lt;private_ALB_ID&gt;</em> with the ID for private application load balancer from the output in the previous step and <em>&lt;user_ip&gt;</em> with the IP address from your user-managed subnet that you want to use.

   ```

### Privately expose apps using a custom domain without TLS
{: #private_ingress_no_tls}

You can configure the private application load balancer to route incoming network traffic to the apps in your cluster using a custom domain.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin, [enable the private application load balancer](#private_ingress).

To privately expose an app using a custom domain without TLS:

1.  Create a custom domain. To create a custom domain, work with your Domain Name Service (DNS) provider to register your custom domain.

2.  Map your custom domain to the portable private IP address of the IBM-provided private application load balancer by adding the IP address as a record. To find the portable private IP address of the private application load balancer, run `bx cs albs --cluster <cluster_name>`.

3.  [Deploy your app to the cluster](cs_app.html#app_cli). When you deploy your app to the cluster, one or more pods are created for you that run your app in a container. Ensure that you add a label to your deployment in the metadata section of your configuration file. This label is needed to identify all pods where your app is running, so that they can be included in the Ingress load balancing.

4.  Create a Kubernetes service for the app to expose. The private application load balancer can include your app into the Ingress load balancing only if your app is exposed via a Kubernetes service inside the cluster.

    1.  Open your preferred editor and create a service configuration file that is named, for example, `myservice.yaml`.
    2.  Define an application load balancer service for the app that you want to expose to the public.

        ```
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        metadata:
          name: <myservice>
        spec:
          selector:
            <selectorkey>: <selectorvalue>
          ports:
           - protocol: TCP
             port: 8080
        ```
       {: codeblock}

        <tr>
        <td><code>name</code></td>
        <td>Replace <em>&lt;myservice1&gt;</em> with a name for your application load balancer service.</td>

        <td><code>selector</code></td>
        <td>Enter the label key (<em>&lt;selectorkey&gt;</em>) and value (<em>&lt;selectorvalue&gt;</em>) pair that you want to use to target the pods where your app runs. For example, if you use the following selector <code>app: code</code>, all pods that have this label in their metadata are included in the load balancing. Enter the same label that you used when you deployed your app to the cluster. </td>
         </tr>
         <td><code>port</code></td>
         <td>The port that the service listens on.</td>
         </tbody></table>

    3.  Save your changes.
    4.  Create the Kubernetes service in your cluster.

        ```
        kubectl apply -f myservice.yaml
        ```
        {: pre}

    5.  Repeat these steps for every app that you want to expose to the private network.
7.  Create an Ingress resource. Ingress resources define the routing rules for the Kubernetes service that you created for your app and are used by the application load balancer to route incoming network traffic to the service. You must use one Ingress resource to define routing rules for multiple apps if every app is exposed via a Kubernetes service inside the cluster.
    1.  Open your preferred editor and create an Ingress configuration file that is named, for example, `myingress.yaml`.
    2.  Define an Ingress resource in your configuration file that uses your custom domain to route incoming network traffic to your services. For every service you can define an individual path that is appended to your custom domain to create a unique path to your app, for example `https://mydomain/myapp`. When you enter this route into a web browser, network traffic is routed to the application load balancer. The application load balancer looks up the associated service and sends network traffic to the service, and further to the pods where the app is running.

        **Note:** It is important that the app listens on the path that you defined in the Ingress resource. Otherwise, network traffic cannot be forwarded to the app. Most apps do not listen on a specific path, but use the root path and a specific port. In this case, define the root path as `/` and do not specify an individual path for your app.

        ```
        apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
        kind: Ingress
        metadata:
          name: <myingressname>
          annotations:
            ingress.bluemix.net/ALB-ID: "<private_ALB_ID>"
        spec:

        <td><code>path</code></td>
        <td>Replace <em>&lt;myservicepath1&gt;</em> with a slash or the unique path that your app is listening on, so that network traffic can be forwarded to the app.

        </br>
        For every Kubernetes service, you can define an individual path that is appended to the custom domain to create a unique path to your app, for example <code>custom_domain/myservicepath1</code>. When you enter this route into a web browser, network traffic is routed to the application load balancer. The application load balancer looks up the associated service, and sends network traffic to the service and to the pods where the app is running by using the same path. The app must be set up to listen on this path in order to receive incoming network traffic.

        </br>
        Many apps do not listen on a specific path, but use the root path and a specific port. In this case, define the root path as <code>/</code> and do not specify an individual path for your app.

        </br></br>
        Examples: <ul><li>For <code>https://mycustomdomain/</code>, enter <code>/</code> as the path.</li><li>For <code>https://mycustomdomain/myservicepath</code>, enter <code>/myservicepath</code> as the path.</li></ul>
        <strong>Tip:</strong> If you want to configure your Ingress to listen on a path that is different to the one that your app listens on, you can use the [rewrite annotation](cs_annotations.html#rewrite-path) to establish proper routing to your app.

    ```
    kubectl describe ingress <myingressname>
    ```
    {: pre}

    **Note:** It might take a few seconds for the Ingress resource to be created properly and for the app to be available.

9.  Access your app from the internet.
    1.  Open your preferred web browser.
    2.  Enter the URL of the app service that you want to access.

### Privately expose apps using a custom domain with TLS
{: #private_ingress_tls}

You can use private application load balancers to route incoming network traffic to apps in your cluster. Also, use your own TLS certificate to manage the TLS termination while using your custom domain.
{:shortdesc}

Before you begin, [enable the default private application load balancer](#private_ingress).

To privately expose an app using a custom domain with TLS:

1.  Create a custom domain. To create a custom domain, work with your Domain Name Service (DNS) provider to register your custom domain.

2.  Map your custom domain to the portable private IP address of the IBM-provided private application load balancer by adding the IP address as a record. To find the portable private IP address of the private application load balancer, run `bx cs albs --cluster <cluster_name>`.

3.  Either import or create a TLS certificate and key secret:
    * If you already have a TLS certificate stored in {{site.data.keyword.cloudcerts_long_notm}} that you want to use, you can import its associated secret into your cluster by running `bx cs alb-cert-deploy --secret-name <secret_name> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --cert-crn <certificate_crn>`.
    * If you do not have a TLS certificate ready, follow these steps:
        1. Create a TLS certificate and key for your domain that is encoded in PEM format.
        2.  Open your preferred editor and create a Kubernetes secret configuration file that is named, for example, `mysecret.yaml`.
        3.  Define a secret that uses your TLS certificate and key. Replace <em>&lt;mytlssecret&gt;</em> with a name for your Kubernetes secret, <em>&lt;tls_key_filepath&gt;</em> with the path to your custom TLS key file, and <em>&lt;tls_cert_filepath&gt;</em> with the path to your custom TLS certificate file.

            ```
            kubectl create secret tls <mytlssecret> --key <tls_key_filepath> --cert <tls_cert_filepath>
            ```
            {: pre}

        4.  Save your configuration file.
        5.  Create the TLS secret for your cluster.

            ```
            kubectl apply -f mysecret.yaml
            ```
            {: pre}

You can further configure an application load balancer with the following options.

-   [Opening ports in the Ingress application load balancer](#opening_ingress_ports)
-   [Configuring SSL protocols and SSL ciphers at the HTTP level](#ssl_protocols_ciphers)
-   [Customizing your application load balancer with annotations](cs_annotations.html)
{: #ingress_annotation}


### Opening ports in the Ingress application load balancer
{: #opening_ingress_ports}

By default, only ports 80 and 443 are exposed in the Ingress application load balancer. To expose other ports, you can edit the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` config map resource.
{:shortdesc}

1.  Create a local version of the configuration file for the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` config map resource. Add a <code>data</code> section and specify public ports 80, 443, and any other ports you want to add to the config map file separated by a semi-colon (;).

 Note: When specifying the ports, 80 and 443 must also be included to keep those ports open. Any port not specified is closed.

 ```
 apiVersion: v1
 data:
   public-ports: "80;443;<port3>"
 kind: ConfigMap
 metadata:
   name: ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm
   namespace: kube-system

### Configuring SSL protocols and SSL ciphers at the HTTP level
{: #ssl_protocols_ciphers}

Enable SSL protocols and ciphers at the global HTTP level by editing the `ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm` config map.
{:shortdesc}

**Note**: When specifying the enabled protocols for all hosts, the TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 parameters (1.1.13, 1.0.12) work only when OpenSSL 1.0.1 or higher is used and the TLSv1.3 parameter (1.13.0) works only when OpenSSL 1.1.1 built with TLSv1.3 support is used.

To edit the config map to enable SSL protocols and ciphers:

1. Create and open a local version of the configuration file for the ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm config map resource.

    ```
    kubectl edit cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Add the SSL protocols and ciphers. Format ciphers according to the [OpenSSL library cipher list format ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/apps/ciphers.html).

   ```
   apiVersion: v1
   data:
     ssl-protocols: "TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2"
     ssl-ciphers: "HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5"
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm
     namespace: kube-system
   ```
   {: codeblock}

2. Apply the configuration file.

   ```
   kubectl apply -f <path/to/configmap.yaml>
   ```
   {: pre}

3. Verify that the configuration file is applied.

   ```
   kubectl describe cm ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm -n kube-system
   ```
   {: pre}

   Output:
   ```
   Name:        ibm-cloud-provider-ingress-cm
   Namespace:    kube-system
   Labels:        <none>
   Annotations:    <none>

    ssl-protocols: "TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2"
    ssl-ciphers: "HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5"
