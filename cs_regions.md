# Regions and locations
{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} is hosted worldwide. A region is a geographic area that is accessed by an endpoint. Locations are data centers within the region. Services within {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} might be available globally, or within a specific region. When you create a cluster in {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}}, its resources remain in the region that you deploy the cluster to.

## {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} region API endpoints and locations
{: #container_regions}

By using {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} regions, you can create or access Kubernetes clusters in a region other than the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} region that you are logged in to. {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} region endpoints refer specifically to the {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}}, not {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} as a whole.
{:shortdesc}

You can access the {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} through one global endpoint: `https://containers.bluemix.net/`.
* To check which {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} region you are currently in, run `bx cs region`.
* To retrieve a list of available regions and their endpoints, run `bx cs regions`.

To use the API with the global endpoint, in all your requests, pass the region name in an `X-Region` header.
{: tip}

### Logging in to a different container service region
{: #container_login_endpoints}

You might want to log in to another {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} region for the following reasons:
  * You created {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services or private Docker images in one region and want to use them with {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} in another region.
  * You want to access a cluster in a region that is different from the default {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} region you are logged in to.

</br>

To quickly switch regions, run `bx cs region-set`.
