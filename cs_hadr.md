# High availability and disaster recovery for {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}
{: #hadr}

High availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR) are core disciplines in an IT infrastructure to keep your apps up and running and to restore your systems after a partial or full site failure. The main target of HADR is to eliminate potential points of failures in an IT infrastructure, for example, by adding redundancy and setting up failover mechanisms. 

HADR can be achieved on different levels in your IT infrastructure and within different components of your cluster. The level of HADR that is right for you depends on your business requirements and the Service Level Agreements that you have with your customers.
