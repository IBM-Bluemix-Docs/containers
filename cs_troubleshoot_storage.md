# Troubleshooting cluster storage
{: #cs_troubleshoot_storage}

As you use {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}, consider these techniques for troubleshooting cluster networking. Before trying these techniques, you can take some general steps to [debug your cluster and check for common issues](cs_troubleshoot.html).
{: shortdesc}

<br />


## File systems for worker nodes change to read-only
{: #readonly_nodes}

{: tsSymptoms}
{: #stuck_creating_state}
You might see one of the following symptoms:
- When you run `kubectl get pods -o wide`, you see that multiple pods that are running on the same worker node are stuck in the `ContainerCreating` state.
- When you run a `kubectl describe` command, you see the following error in the events section: `MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume ... read-only file system`.

{: tsCauses}
The file system on the worker node is read-only.

{: tsResolve}
1. Back up any data that might be stored on the worker node or in your containers.
2. For a short-term fix to the existing worker node, reload the worker node.

<pre class="pre"><code>bx cs worker-reload &lt;cluster_name&gt; &lt;worker_id&gt;</code></pre>

For a long-term fix, [update the machine type by adding another worker node](cs_cluster_update.html#machine_type).

<br />


## Adding non-root user access to persistent storage fails
{: #cs_storage_nonroot}

{: tsSymptoms}
After [adding non-root user access to persistent storage](cs_storage.html#nonroot) or deploying a Helm chart with a non-root user ID specified, the user cannot write to the mounted storage.

{: tsCauses}
The deployment or Helm chart configuration specifies the [security context](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/) for the pod's `fsGroup` (group ID) and `runAsUser` (user ID). Currently, {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} does not support the `fsGroup` specification, and only supports `runAsUser` set as `0` (root permissions).

{: tsResolve}
Remove the configuration's `securityContext` fields for `fsGroup` and `runAsUser` from the image, deployment or Helm chart configuration file and redeploy. If you need to change the ownership of the mount path from `nobody`, [add non-root user access](cs_storage.html#nonroot).
