# Troubleshooting cluster storage
{: #cs_troubleshoot_storage}

As you use {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}, consider these techniques for troubleshooting cluster storage.
{: shortdesc}

If you have a more general issue, try out [cluster debugging](cs_troubleshoot.html).
{: tip}

## File systems for worker nodes change to read-only
{: #readonly_nodes}

{: tsSymptoms}
{: #stuck_creating_state}
You might see one of the following symptoms:
- When you run `kubectl get pods -o wide`, you see that multiple pods that are running on the same worker node are stuck in the `ContainerCreating` state.
- When you run a `kubectl describe` command, you see the following error in the events section: `MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume ... read-only file system`.

{: tsCauses}
The file system on the worker node is read-only.

{: tsResolve}
1.  Back up any data that might be stored on the worker node or in your containers.
2.  For a short-term fix to the existing worker node, reload the worker node.
    <pre class="pre"><code>bx cs worker-reload &lt;cluster_name&gt; &lt;worker_ID&gt;</code></pre>

For a long-term fix, [update the machine type by adding another worker node](cs_cluster_update.html#machine_type).

## App fails when a non-root user owns the NFS file storage mount path
{: #nonroot}

{: tsSymptoms}
After [adding NFS storage](cs_storage.html#app_volume_mount) to your deployment, the deployment of your container fails. When you retrieve the logs for your container, you might see errors such as "write-permission" or "do not have required permission". The pod fails and is stuck in a reload cycle.

{: tsCauses}
By default, non-root users do not have write permission on the volume mount path for NFS-backed storage. Some common app images, such as Jenkins and Nexus3, specify a non-root user that owns the mount path in the Dockerfile. When you create a container from this Dockerfile, the creation of the container fails due to insufficient permissions of the non-root user on the mount path. To grant write permission, you can modify the Dockerfile to temporarily add the non-root user to the root user group before changing the mount path permissions, or use an init container.

If you are using a Helm chart to deploy an image with a non-root user that you want to have write permissions on the NFS file share, first edit the Helm deployment to use an init container.
{:tip}



{: tsResolve}
When you include an [init container![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/) in your deployment, you can give a non-root user that is specified in your Dockerfile write permissions to the volume mount path inside the container that points to your NFS file share. The init container starts before your app container starts. The init container creates the volume mount path inside the container, changes the mount path to be owned by the correct (non-root) user, and closes. Then, your app container starts, which includes the non-root user that must write to the mount path. Because the path is already owned by the non-root user, writing to the mount path is successful. If you do not want to use an init container, you can modify the Dockerfile to add non-root user access to NFS file storage.


Before you begin, [target your CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to your cluster.

1.  Open the Dockerfile for your app and get the user ID (UID) and group ID (GID) from the user that you want to give writer permission on the volume mount path. In the example from a Jenkins Dockerfile, the information is:
    - UID: `1000`
    - GID: `1000`

    **Example**:

    ```
    FROM openjdk:8-jdk

    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

    ARG user=jenkins
    ARG group=jenkins
    ARG uid=1000
    ARG gid=1000
    ARG http_port=8080
    ARG agent_port=50000

    ENV JENKINS_HOME /var/jenkins_home
    ENV JENKINS_SLAVE_AGENT_PORT ${agent_port}
    ...
    ```
    {:screen}

2.  Add persistent storage to your app by creating a persistent volume claim (PVC). This example uses the `ibmc-file-bronze` storage class. To review available storage classes, run `kubectl get storageclasses`.

    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    metadata:
      name: mypvc
      annotations:
        volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: "ibmc-file-bronze"
    spec:
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteMany
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 20Gi
    ```
    {: codeblock}

3.  Create the PVC.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f mypvc.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

4.  In your deployment `.yaml` file, add the init container. Include the UID and GID that you previously retrieved.

    ```
    initContainers:
    - name: initContainer # Or you can replace with any name
      image: alpine:latest
      command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
      args:
        - chown <UID>:<GID> /mount; # Replace UID and GID with values from the Dockerfile
      volumeMounts:
      - name: volume # Or you can replace with any name
        mountPath: /mount # Must match the mount path in the args line
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    **Example** for a Jenkins deployment:

    ```
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: my_pod
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: jenkins
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: jenkins
            image: jenkins
            volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /var/jenkins_home
              name: volume
          volumes:
          - name: volume
            persistentVolumeClaim:
              claimName: mypvc
          initContainers:
          - name: permissionsfix
            image: alpine:latest
            command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
            args:
              - chown 1000:1000 /mount;
            volumeMounts:
            - name: volume
              mountPath: /mount
    ```
    {: codeblock}

5.  Create the pod and mount the PVC to your pod.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f my_pod.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

6. Verify that the volume is successfully mounted to your pod. Note the pod name and **Containers/Mounts** path.

    ```
    kubectl describe pod <my_pod>
    ```
    {: pre}

    **Example output**:

    ```
    Name:       mypod-123456789
    Namespace:	default
    ...
    Init Containers:
    ...
    Mounts:
      /mount from volume (rw)
      /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount from default-token-cp9f0 (ro)
    ...
    Containers:
      jenkins:
        Container ID:
        Image:		jenkins
        Image ID:
        Port:		  <none>
        State:		Waiting
          Reason:		PodInitializing
        Ready:		False
        Restart Count:	0
        Environment:	<none>
        Mounts:
          /var/jenkins_home from volume (rw)
          /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount from default-token-cp9f0 (ro)
    ...
    Volumes:
      myvol:
        Type:	PersistentVolumeClaim (a reference to a PersistentVolumeClaim in the same namespace)
        ClaimName:	mypvc
        ReadOnly:	  false

    ```
    {: screen}

7.  Log in to the pod by using the pod name that you previously noted.

    ```
    kubectl exec -it <my_pod-123456789> /bin/bash
    ```
    {: pre}

8. Verify the permissions of your container's mount path. In the example, the mount path is `/var/jenkins_home`.

    ```
    ls -ln /var/jenkins_home
    ```
    {: pre}

    **Example output**:

    ```
    jenkins@mypod-123456789:/$ ls -ln /var/jenkins_home
    total 12
    -rw-r--r-- 1 1000 1000  102 Mar  9 19:58 copy_reference_file.log
    drwxr-xr-x 2 1000 1000 4096 Mar  9 19:58 init.groovy.d
    drwxr-xr-x 9 1000 1000 4096 Mar  9 20:16 war
    ```
    {: screen}

    This output shows that the GID and UID from your Dockerfile (in this example, `1000` and `1000`) own the mount path inside the container.

## Adding non-root user access to persistent storage fails
{: #cs_storage_nonroot}

{: tsSymptoms}
After [adding non-root user access to persistent storage](#nonroot) or deploying a Helm chart with a non-root user ID specified, the user cannot write to the mounted storage.

{: tsCauses}
The deployment or Helm chart configuration specifies the [security context](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/) for the pod's `fsGroup` (group ID) and `runAsUser` (user ID). Currently, {{site.data.keyword.containershort_notm}} does not support the `fsGroup` specification, and only supports `runAsUser` set as `0` (root permissions).

{: tsResolve}
Remove the configuration's `securityContext` fields for `fsGroup` and `runAsUser` from the image, deployment or Helm chart configuration file and redeploy. If you need to change the ownership of the mount path from `nobody`, [add non-root user access](#nonroot). After adding the [non-root initContainer](#nonroot), set `runAsUser` at the container level, not the pod level.
