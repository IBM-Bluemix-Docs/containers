# Saving data in your cluster
{: #storage}
You can persist data in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} to share data between app instances and to protect your data from being lost if a component in your Kubernetes cluster fails.

## Planning highly available storage
{: #planning}

In {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} you can choose from several options to store your app data and share data across pods in your cluster. However, not all storage options offer the same level of persistence and availability in situations where a component in your cluster or a whole site fails.
{: shortdesc}

### Non-persistent data storage options
{: #non_persistent}

You can use non-persistent storage options if your data is not required to be persistently stored, so that you can recover it after a component in your cluster fails, or if data does not need to be shared across app instances. Non-persistent storage options can also be used to unit-test your app components or try out new features.
{: shortdesc}

The following image shows available non-persistent data storage options in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}. These options are available for free and standard clusters.

### Persistent data storage options for high availability
{: persistent}

The main challenge when you create highly available stateful apps is to persist data across multiple app instances in multiple locations, and to keep data in sync at all times. For high available data, you want to make sure that you have a master database with multiple instances that are spread across multiple data centers or even multiple regions, and that data in this master is continuously replicated. All instances in your cluster must read from and write to this master database. In case one instance of the master is down, other instances can take over the workload, so that you do not experience downtime for your apps.
{: shortdesc}

The following image shows the options that you have in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} to make your data highly available in a standard cluster. The option that is right for you depends on the following factors:
  * **The type of app that you have:** For example, you might have an app that must store data on a file basis rather than inside a database.
  * **Legal requirements for where to store and route the data:** For example, you might be obligated to store and route data in the United States only and you cannot use a service that is located in Europe.
  * **Backup and restore options:** Every storage options comes with capabilities to backup and restore data. Check that available backup and restore options meet the requirements of your disaster recovery plan, such as the frequency of backups or the capabilities of storing data outside your primary data center.
  * **Global replication:** For high availability, you might want to set up multiple instances of storage that are distributed and replicated across data centers worldwide.

## Using existing NFS file shares in clusters
{: #existing}

If you already have existing NFS file shares in your IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) account that you want to use with Kubernetes, you can do so by creating a persistent volume (PV) for your existing storage.
{:shortdesc}

A persistent volume (PV) is a Kubernetes resource that represents an actual storage device that is provisioned in a data center. Persistent volumes abstract the details of how a specific storage type is provisioned by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Storage. To mount a PV to your cluster, you must request persistent storage for your pod by creating a persistent volume claim (PVC). The following diagram illustrates the relationship between PVs and PVCs.

![Create persistent volumes and persistent volume claims](images/cs_cluster_pv_pvc.png)

 As depicted in the diagram, to enable existing NFS file shares to be used with Kubernetes, you must create PVs with a certain size and access mode and create a PVC that matches the PV specification. If the PV and PVC match, they are bound to each other. Only bound PVCs can be used by the cluster user to mount the volume to a deployment. This process is referred to as static provisioning of persistent storage.

Before you begin, make sure that you have an existing NFS file share that you can use to create your PV. For example, if you previously [created a PVC with a `retain` storage class policy](#create), you can use that retained data in the existing NFS file share for this new PVC.

**Note:** Static provisioning of persistent storage only applies to existing NFS file shares. If you do not have existing NFS file shares, cluster users can use the [dynamic provisioning](cs_storage.html#create) process to add PVs.

To create a PV and matching PVC, follow these steps.

1.  In your IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) account, look up the ID and path of the NFS file share where you want to create your PV object. In addition, authorize the file storage to the subnets in the cluster. This authorization gives your cluster access to the storage.
    1.  Log in to your IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) account.
    2.  Click **Storage**.
    3.  Click **File Storage** and from the **Actions** menu, select **Authorize Host**.
    4.  Select **Subnets**.
    5.  From the drop down list, select the private VLAN subnet that your worker node is connected to. To find the subnet of your worker node, run `bx cs workers <cluster_name>` and compare the `Private IP` of your worker node with the subnet that you found in the drop down list.
    6.  Click **Submit**.
    6.  Click the name of the file storage.
    7.  Make note the **Mount Point** field. The field is displayed as `<server>:/<path>`.
2.  Create a storage configuration file for your PV. Include the server and path from the file storage **Mount Point** field.

    ```
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolume
    metadata:
     name: mypv

    <td>Enter the path to the NFS file share where you want to create the PV object.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody></table>

3.  Create the PV object in your cluster.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f <yaml_path>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example

    ```
    kubectl apply -f deploy/kube-config/pv.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

4.  Verify that the PV is created.

    ```
    kubectl get pv
    ```
    {: pre}

5.  Create another configuration file to create your PVC. In order for the PVC to match the PV object that you created earlier, you must choose the same value for `storage` and `accessMode`. The `storage-class` field must be empty. If any of these fields do not match the PV, then a new PV is created automatically instead.

    ```
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
     name: mypvc
     annotations:
       volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: ""
    spec:
     accessModes:
       - ReadWriteMany
     resources:
       requests:
         storage: "20Gi"
    ```
    {: codeblock}

6.  Create your PVC.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f deploy/kube-config/mypvc.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}

7.  Verify that your PVC is created and bound to the PV object. This process can take a few minutes.

    ```
    kubectl describe pvc mypvc
    ```
    {: pre}

    Your output looks similar to the following.

    ```

## Adding NFS file storage to apps
{: #create}

Create a persistent volume claim (PVC) to provision NFS file storage for your cluster. Then, mount this claim to a persistent volume (PV) to ensure that data is available even if the pods crash or shut down.
{:shortdesc}

The NFS file storage that backs the PV is clustered by IBM in order to provide high availability for your data. The storage classes describe the types of storage offerings available and define aspects such as the data retention policy, size in gigabytes, and IOPS when you create your PV.



**Before you begin**: If you have a firewall, [allow egress access](cs_firewall.html#pvc) for the IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) IP ranges of the locations (data centers) that your clusters are in, so that you can create PVCs.

To add persistent storage:

1.  Review the available storage classes. {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} provides pre-defined storage classes for NFS file storage so that the cluster admin does not have to create any storage classes. The `ibmc-file-bronze` storage class is the same as the `default` storage class.

    ```
    kubectl get storageclasses
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```
    $ kubectl get storageclasses
    NAME                         TYPE
    default                      ibm.io/ibmc-file
    ibmc-file-bronze (default)   ibm.io/ibmc-file
    ibmc-file-custom             ibm.io/ibmc-file
    ibmc-file-gold               ibm.io/ibmc-file
    ibmc-file-retain-bronze      ibm.io/ibmc-file
    ibmc-file-retain-custom      ibm.io/ibmc-file
    ibmc-file-retain-gold        ibm.io/ibmc-file
    ibmc-file-retain-silver      ibm.io/ibmc-file
    ibmc-file-silver             ibm.io/ibmc-file
    ```
    {: screen}

    **Tip:** If you want to change the default storage class, run `kubectl patch storageclass <storageclass> -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'` and replace `<storageclass>` with the name of the storage class.

2.  Decide if you want to keep your data and the NFS file share after you delete the PVC.
    - If you want to keep your data, then choose a `retain` storage class. When you delete the PVC, the PV is removed, but the NFS file and your data still exist in your IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer) account. Later, to access this data in your cluster, create a PVC and a matching PV that refers to your existing [NFS file](#existing).
    - If you want the data and your NFS file share to be deleted when you delete the PVC, choose a storage class without `retain`.

3.  **If you choose a bronze, silver, or gold storage class**: You get [Endurance storage ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/topic/endurance-storage) that defines the IOPS per GB for each class. However, you can determine the total IOPS by choosing a size within the available range. You can select any whole number of gigabyte sizes within the allowed size range (such as 20 Gi, 256 Gi, 11854 Gi). For example, if you select a 1000Gi file share size in the silver storage class of 4 IOPS per GB, your volume has a total of 4000 IOPS. The more IOPS your PV has, the faster it processes input and output operations. The following table describes the IOPS per gigabyte and size range for each storage class.

    <table>
         <caption>Table of storage class size ranges and IOPS per gigabyte</caption>
         <thead>
         <th>Storage class</th>
         <th>IOPS per gigabyte</th>
         <th>Size range in gigabytes</th>

         <td>Silver</td>
         <td>4 IOPS/GB</td>
         <td>20-12000 Gi</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
         <td>Gold</td>
         <td>10 IOPS/GB</td>

         </tbody></table>

    <p>**Example command to show the details of a storage class**:</p>

    <pre class="pre"><code>kubectl describe storageclasses ibmc-file-silver</code></pre>

4.  **If you choose the custom storage class**: You get [Performance storage ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/topic/performance-storage) and have more control over choosing the combination of IOPS and size. For example, if you select a size of 40Gi for your PVC, you can choose IOPS that is a multiple of 100 that is in the range of 100 - 2000 IOPS. The following table shows you what range of IOPS you can choose depending on the size that you select.

5.  Decide whether you want to be billed on an hourly or monthly basis. By default, you are billed monthly.

6.  Create a configuration file to define your PVC and save the configuration as a `.yaml` file.

    -  **Example for bronze, silver, gold storage classes**:
       The following `.yaml` file creates a claim that is named `mypvc` of the `"ibmc-file-silver"` storage class, billed `"hourly"`, with a gigabyte size of `24Gi`. 

       ```
       apiVersion: v1
       kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
       metadata:
         name: mypvc
         annotations:
           volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: "ibmc-file-silver"
         labels:
           billingType: "hourly"
       spec:
         accessModes:
           - ReadWriteMany
         resources:
           requests:
             storage: 24Gi
        ```
        {: codeblock}

    -  **Example for custom storage classes**:
       The following `.yaml` file creates a claim that is named `mypvc` of the storage class `ibmc-file-retain-custom`, billed at the default of `"monthly"`, with a gigabyte size of `45Gi` and IOPS of `"300"`.

       ```
       apiVersion: v1
       kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
       metadata:

## Setting up backup and restore solutions for NFS file shares
{: #backup_restore}

File shares are provisioned into the same location as your cluster. The storage is hosted on clustered servers by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} to provide availability in case a server goes down. However, file shares  are not backed up automatically and might be inaccessible if the entire location fails. To protect your data from being lost or damaged, you can set up periodic backups that you can use to restore your data when needed.
{: shortdesc}

Review the following backup and restore options for your NFS file shares:

<dl>
  <dt>Set up periodic snapshots</dt>
  <dd><p>You can set up [periodic snapshots](/docs/infrastructure/FileStorage/snapshots.html) for your NFS file share, which is a read-only image that captures the state of the instance at a point in time. Snapshots are stored on the same file share within the same location. You can restore data from a snapshot if a user accidentally removes important data from the volume.</p>
  <p>For more information, see [periodic snapshots](/docs/infrastructure/FileStorage/snapshots.html) for your NFS file share.</p></dd>
  <dt>Replicate snapshots to another location</dt>
 <dd><p>To protect your data from a location failure, you can [replicate snapshots](/docs/infrastructure/FileStorage/replication.html#working-with-replication) to an NFS file share instance that is set up in another location. Data can be replicated from the primary storage to the backup storage only. You cannot mount a replicated NFS file share instance to a cluster. When your primary storage fails, you can manually set your replicated backup storage to be the primary one. Then, you can mount it to your cluster. After your primary storage is restored, you can restore the data from the backup storage.</p>
 <p>For more information, see [replicate snapshots](/docs/infrastructure/FileStorage/replication.html#working-with-replication) to an NFS file share.</p></dd>
 <dt>Duplicate storage</dt>
 <dd><p>You can duplicate your NFS file share instance in the same location as the original storage instance. A duplicate has the same data as the original storage instance at the point in time that you create the duplicate. Unlike replicas, use the duplicate as a completely independent storage instance from the original. To duplicate, first set up snapshots for the volume.</p>
 <p>For more information, see [creating a duplicate NFS file storage](/docs/infrastructure/FileStorage/how-to-create-duplicate-volume.html#creating-a-duplicate-file-storage).</p></dd>
  <dt>Backup data to Object Storage</dt>
  <dd><p>You can use the [**ibm-backup-restore image**](/docs/services/RegistryImages/ibm-backup-restore/index.html#ibmbackup_restore_starter) to spin up a backup and restore pod in your cluster. This pod contains a script to run a one-time or periodic backup for any persistent volume claim (PVC) in your cluster. Data is stored in your {{site.data.keyword.objectstoragefull}} instance that you set up in a location.</p>
  <p>To make your data even more highly available and protect your app from a location failure, set up a second {{site.data.keyword.objectstoragefull}} instance and replicate data across locations. If you need to restore data from your {{site.data.keyword.objectstoragefull}} instance, use the restore script that is provided with the image.</p></dd>
<dt>Copy data to and from pods and containers</dt>
<dd><p>You can use the `kubectl cp` [command![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#cp) to copy files and directories to and from pods or specific containers in your cluster.</p>
<p>Before you begin, [target your Kubernetes CLI](cs_cli_install.html#cs_cli_configure) to the cluster that you want to use. If you do not specify a container with <code>-c</code>, the command uses to the first available container in the pod.</p>
<p>You can use the command in various ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy data from your local machine to a pod in your cluster: <code>kubectl cp <var>&lt;local_filepath&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;</var> <var>&lt;namespace&gt;/&lt;pod&gt;:&lt;pod_filepath&gt;</var></code></li>
<li>Copy data from a pod in your cluster to your local machine: <code>kubectl cp <var>&lt;namespace&gt;/&lt;pod&gt;:&lt;pod_filepath&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;</var> <var>&lt;local_filepath&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;</var></code></li>
<li>Copy data from a pod in your cluster to a specific container in another pod another: <code>kubectl cp <var>&lt;namespace&gt;/&lt;pod&gt;:&lt;pod_filepath&gt;</var> <var>&lt;namespace&gt;/&lt;other_pod&gt;:&lt;pod_filepath&gt;</var> -c <var>&lt;container></var></code></li>
</ul>
</dd>
  </dl>
