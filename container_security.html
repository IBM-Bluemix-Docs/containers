<dd>The Docker daemons that run on the IBM compute hosts are set up without direct user access

<dt class="dlterm">Enabled Docker user namespaces</dt>
<dd>The <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/">Docker user
namespace</a> feature is enabled in the Docker Engine on the compute hosts. The user namespace
feature isolates processes that run inside a container from all other processes and containers that
run on the same compute host. The effective root user inside the container is mapped to a non-root
user on the compute host. Even if a root user managed to break out of the container, the user does
not have any permissions to manipulate files, processes, or other containers that run on the compute
host.</dd>
<dt class="dlterm">No privileged containers allowed</dt>
<dd>The <samp class="ph codeph">--privileged</samp> option in the <samp class="ph codeph">run</samp> command is not supported.

<dt class="dlterm">Managed control groups (cgroups) for memory, CPU, and disk space</dt>
<dd>Containers that run on the same compute host share memory, CPU, and disk space. To prevent a
container from either consuming all available resources or bringing down applications or host
systems, the maximum amount of memory, CPU, and disk space that can be assigned to a container is
limited. <p>The amount of memory, CPU, and disk space that is available to the container during
runtime is determined by the container size that you select during container creation. This
limitation ensures that every container on the compute host gets its fair share of the available
host resources. If a container misbehaves, the resource capping ensures a consistent performance and
behavior for other containers on the compute host. </p>
</dd>
<dt class="dlterm">Compute host kernel optimization</dt>
<dd>Compute host kernels limit the total number of threads and processes that can run on the compute
host by a specific user or group. This optimization ensures that the host is not overloaded and does
not run out of process slots until the user's maximum is reached.</dd>
<dt class="dlterm">Continuous compute host monitoring</dt>
<dd>Every compute host is continuously monitored by IBM to control and
remediate fork-bombs and other process level Denial-Of-Service (DOS) attacks. </dd>
<dt class="dlterm">Enabled AppArmor profile for Docker containers</dt>
<dd>Every compute host applies the IBM-specific <a href="http://wiki.apparmor.net/index.php/Documentation" rel="external" target="_blank" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">AppArmor</a> profile to secure the environment and restrict the capabilities of a
container on the compute host. AppArmor is a Linux kernel security module that controls the access
to folders, files, network domains, and permissions to create and change data.</dd>

<dd><span class="keyword">IBM

</dd>
<dt class="dlterm">Keep containers private or selectively expose public facing services through Network Security

<dd>Every container is protected by IBM-specific Network Security Groups that control the inbound
network traffic and serve as a software firewall on the private network gateway level. Data that is
sent through the private network gateway is checked for compliance against the Network Security
Group rules and can either be passed to the recipient container or blocked. <p>When you create a
container and do not expose it publicly, it is set up with the default Private Network Security
Group. This security group allows private network communication between containers by using the
private IP addresses. By default, all container ports are automatically exposed on the private
network. You do not have to map the container ports to a host port.</p>
<p>To make your app available publicly, you must expose a public port and bind either a
public IP address to your single container, or a public route to your container group. <span class="ph" id="container_security_network__public_nsg">When you expose a public port by using the <samp class="ph codeph">-p</samp> option in the
