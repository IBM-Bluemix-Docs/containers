<p>A person is displayed alongside a grey box labeled A. The person represents a user and box A
represents a container group.</p>
<p>Inside box A, a blue box is displayed and labeled B, which represents the load balancer for the
container group.</p>
<p>Also inside box A, three boxes are displayed, which represents three instances within the
container group.</p>
<p>A request is sent from the user through the load balancer, and then to the first container group
instance. This request spins and when it completes, it fades.</p>
<p>A communication is sent from the user through the load balancer, and then to the second instance.
This request spins and does not complete. The request continues to spin.</p>
<p>A communication is sent from the user through the load balancer, and then to the third instance.
This request spins and when it completes, it fades.</p>

fades, the next request spins and when it completes, it fades.</p>
